IWSLT 2013 evaluation campaign: training/development data

# Copyright: TED Conference LLC
# License: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0

For each language pair x-y, the in-domain parallel training data is
provided through the following files:

train.tags.x-y.x
train.tags.x-y.y

They include transcripts and manual translations of the talks
available at the TED website for each pair x-y in June 2013. The talks
included in the development (and forthcoming evaluation) sets have been
removed.

The transcripts are given as pure text (UTF8 encoding), one or more
sentences per line, and are aligned (at language pair level, not
across pairs). The simplified set of characters is employed for
Chinese text. No segmentation/preprocessing has been applied to Arabic
nor to Chinese.

Monolingual training data is included in the file:

train.x
train.y

while for tuning/development purposes, the following files are
released:

IWSLT13.TED.dev2010.x-y.x.xml
IWSLT13.TED.dev2010.x-y.y.xml
IWSLT13.TED.tst2010.x-y.x.xml
IWSLT13.TED.tst2010.x-y.y.xml

with the exception of the pair Slovenian-English for which only one
development set (dev2012) is released.

Below further information about released files is provided.

The released files are in xml format. Each talk defines a single
document, for which the following tags are provided:

<url>: the url of the page with the text
<description>: a brief description of the talk
<keywords>: keywords of the talk
<talkid>: a numeric identfier of the talk
<title>: the title of the talk

Text is segmented in sentences. Segments can include more than a
single sentence. Segments of files *.x-y.x.xml and *.x-y.y.xml are
aligned.

UTF8 encoding is used.  The simplified set of characters is employed
for Chinese text. No segmentation/preprocessing has been applied to
Arabic nor to Chinese.
