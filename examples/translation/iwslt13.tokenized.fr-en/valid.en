the connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple ad@@ ages ,
they accumul@@ ate into the top of it .
now , the mother then can go and re@@ produce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accumul@@ ation of this pollu@@ tant in these animals -- the death of the fir@@ st-@@ born cal@@ f .
because mothers who may be bre@@ ast@@ feeding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really tox@@ ic .
now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , &quot; closed because human se@@ w@@ age is so far over this park that you can &apos;t use it &quot; ?
that has s@@ par@@ ked chol@@ era epidem@@ ics in ports along the world and has led to increas@@ ed concentration on trying to make sure shi@@ pping doesn &apos;t move these v@@ ect@@ ors of chol@@ era around the world .
that change in thinking has led to a dra@@ matic shift , not only in the for@@ tu@@ nes of monter@@ ey bay , but other places around the world .
they get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of dri@@ ft all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
hand@@ spring pu@@ pp@@ et co . : the geni@@ us pu@@ p@@ pe@@ try behind war horse
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up@@ -@@ to-@@ the-@@ minute 17@@ th century technology -- to turn n@@ oun@@ s into ver@@ bs .
b@@ j : but it had to ride . it had to have a ri@@ der .
we opened the li@@ d , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ri@@ dden .
ak : jo@@ ey , jo@@ ey , jo@@ ey , jo@@ ey .
but we realized that , if that were to be happening , you wouldn &apos;t , as an audience , see the breath .
thank you . thank you .
instead , what i want to do is talk about the philanthro@@ p@@ y of all of us :
om@@ id@@ y@@ ar network has made a big investment in don@@ or@@ scho@@ ose .
you can look to these innov@@ ators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution .
many of you will realize that i &apos;m ri@@ pping a bit off of the science fiction writer ver@@ nor v@@ in@@ ge &apos;s notion of a technological sin@@ gu@@ lar@@ ity , where a number of tr@@ ends acceler@@ ate and conver@@ ge and come together to create , really , a sho@@ c@@ king@@ ly new reality .
and i want you to imagine that it &apos;s 100 years from now , and your grand@@ child , or great@@ -@@ grand@@ child , or ni@@ e@@ ce or ne@@ ph@@ e@@ w or go@@ d-@@ child , is looking at this photograph of you .
now , you may push the car to the lim@@ its not because you &apos;re driving too fast , but because you &apos;ve hit an ic@@ y pat@@ ch of road , conditions have changed .
so as researchers , that &apos;s what we decided to find out .
not surpris@@ ingly , you can see this is a pretty challeng@@ ing task .
can , in fact , the technology not simply re@@ place humans , but allow us to reach the level of re@@ fle@@ x and intuition that we &apos;re all capable of ?
academ@@ ic research on instant mess@@ aging also shows 100 people on bud@@ dy li@@ sts , but fundament@@ ally people chat with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
and finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put instant mess@@ aging on their computers at work .
and of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concentr@@ ate and focus your attention .
and every day , every single day , i read news that makes me cr@@ in@@ ge , like a $ 15 fine to kids in texas , for using , every time they take out their mobile phone in school .
and lots of people know that l@@ .@@ a@@ . has its issues .
and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emp@@ ti@@ ed , leaving even more un@@ employ@@ ment in their wake .
but these three people don &apos;t know each other , but they do have an awful lot in common .
me@@ ga agri@@ cultural oper@@ ations often are responsible for pois@@ oning our water@@ ways and our land , and it produ@@ ces this incredibly un@@ healthy product that costs us billions in health@@ care and lost produc@@ tivity .
the sum of the local is the global .
i spent some years watching how good int@@ entions for community em@@ power@@ ment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and em@@ power it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and we were able to grow cher@@ ry tom@@ ato@@ es and cu@@ cu@@ m@@ bers , all kinds of stuff .
if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we &apos;re all talking about as environ@@ ment@@ alis@@ ts and food people , maybe we just need to dit@@ ch the term &quot; consumer &quot; and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
and probably , if i were to fill out jim ci@@ tr@@ in &apos;s scale , i &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equ@@ ation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
it &apos;s really important . using applications is ok , but program@@ ming is absolutely fundamental .
you want a separate thing , like the ac adap@@ tor .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
not something you &apos;d en@@ v@@ y or want to do .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
and when i look out in the future , i can &apos;t imagine a world , 500 years from now , where we don &apos;t have robots everywhere . as@@ sum@@ ing -- despite all the dire predic@@ tions from many people about our future -- as@@ sum@@ ing we &apos;re still around , i can &apos;t imagine the world not being popul@@ ated with robots .
this is a robot that you can go out and buy , and that will clean up your floor .
we had the robots down at the world trade center late that ev@@ ening .
he sort of does that . but i &apos;m going to -- chris anderson : i &apos;m just british . rb : oh .
it looks for highly satur@@ ated colors , from to@@ ys .
and so we have the robot measure pro@@ so@@ dy for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre-@@ lin@@ gu@@ is@@ tically .
and i want you to watch carefully , at the beginning of this , where this person , rit@@ ch@@ ie , who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes -- -- says , &quot; i want to show you something .
it &apos;s all mechan@@ istic . we are mechan@@ ism .
a story , a work of art , a face , a designed object -- how do we tell that something is beautiful ? and why does it matter so much to us ? designer richard se@@ ym@@ our explor@@ es our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhi@@ bit it .
and then somebody , i think it was b@@ m@@ w , introduced a light that went out slowly .
now i &apos;m not a neuro@@ scientist .
now i &apos;m going to tell you what it is . are you ready ?
poign@@ ancy is a word i love as a designer .
and as a designer , i can &apos;t help me@@ dd@@ ling with this , so i pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this , and tried to understand what the individual elements were , but feeling it as i go .
i &apos;m getting terri@@ bly excited as my mind and my eyes fli@@ ck across these things .
pretty ? yes .
and part of the joy of it is , you know the difficul@@ ty .
what &apos;s incredible about this , and the way i love to come back to it , is this is taking something that you hate or bor@@ es you , fol@@ ding clo@@ thes , and if you can actually do this -- who can actually do this ? anybody try to do this ?
and for the last decade or so , it &apos;s been quite clear what being an a@@ the@@ ist means .
i think there are ways -- and i &apos;m being both very resp@@ ect@@ ful and completely im@@ pi@@ ous -- of ste@@ aling from religions .
if you went to a top university -- let &apos;s say you went to harvard or oxford or cambridge -- and you said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here because i &apos;m in search of mor@@ ality , gu@@ id@@ ance and con@@ sol@@ ation ; i want to know how to live , &quot; they would show you the way to the in@@ san@@ e as@@ y@@ lu@@ m .
another point about education : we tend to believe in the modern sec@@ ular world that if you tell someone something once , they &apos;ll remember it .
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up ritu@@ als around important feelings .
you immer@@ se yourself in the water , and a physical action bac@@ ks up a philosophi@@ cal idea .
art is a vis@@ cer@@ al encoun@@ ter with the most important ideas of your faith .
they group together , they form institutions .
look very clo@@ sely at pil@@ gri@@ mage .
there &apos;s so much we can absor@@ b .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and i went to see one of these experiments , and this is actually -- you can bar@@ ely see it , and the reason for that is it &apos;s entirely dark in there --
so they wait until winter -- the lake is completely fro@@ zen over -- and they use this met@@ er-@@ th@@ ick ice as a platform on which to estab@@ lish their ice camp and do their work .
an extraordinary set of tel@@ escop@@ es .
what i want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight .
and i would like to share with you a laun@@ ch .
car@@ ved above their door is , &quot; free to all . &quot; it &apos;s kind of an inspir@@ ing st@@ atement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
then the question is , what do you get ?
and this is the opening day at the library of alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , the new library of alex@@ and@@ ri@@ a , in eg@@ y@@ pt .
you actually can go and read scann@@ ed books quite easily .
and with two digital , high-@@ grade , professional digital cameras , controlled museum ligh@@ ting , so even if it &apos;s a black and white book , you can go and get the pro@@ per int@@ on@@ ation .
but anyway , lo@@ an@@ ing ou@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ print works from the boston public library , the wo@@ ods hole oce@@ an@@ ographic institute and a few other libr@@ aries that are starting to particip@@ ate in this program , to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bo@@ ok@@ store take over .
they give permission , and we get about 40 or 50 concer@@ ts a day .
so 15 dollars per video hour , and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per cellu@@ lo@@ id hour , we &apos;re able to go and get materials online very in@@ expen@@ si@@ vely and have them up on the net .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
f@@ lowers will arrive by the tru@@ ck@@ load .
i love a challenge , and saving the earth is probably a good one .
fun@@ g@@ i don &apos;t like to ro@@ t from bacteria , and so our best antibio@@ tics come from fun@@ g@@ i .
the my@@ cel@@ ium is senti@@ ent .
all across most land masses .
some of these mus@@ h@@ rooms are very happy mus@@ h@@ rooms .
this is extremely rare fun@@ g@@ us .
i did something that nobody else had done .
the life box -- you &apos;re g@@ onn@@ a be getting a d@@ v@@ d of the ted conference -- you add soil , you add water , you have my@@ cor@@ r@@ hi@@ z@@ al and end@@ op@@ hy@@ tic fun@@ g@@ i as well as spor@@ es , like of the ag@@ ari@@ k@@ on mus@@ h@@ room .
and the wonderful thing about that is that i get to compare bio@@ sp@@ her@@ es . and hopefully from that i get to learn something .
but of course none of that happened .
when i brea@@ th@@ ed out , my co2 f@@ ed the sweet pot@@ ato@@ es that i was growing .
and we had sleep ap@@ ne@@ a at night .
because , in fact , although you might say we had discovered something that was quite &quot; u@@ h@@ h , &quot; when your oxygen is going down , stopped working , essentially , in your life support system , that &apos;s a very bad failure .
so i went about my business : par@@ ag@@ on space development corpor@@ ation , a little fir@@ m i started with people while i was in the bio@@ sphere , because i had nothing else to do .
and what this project was doing was taking the eff@@ lu@@ ent of these , and turning them into all of this food .
it &apos;s a certain type of a@@ es@@ thetic .
there may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs .
we think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of fac@@ tors .
i mean , there may be 100 explan@@ ations for why hai@@ ti is the im@@ pover@@ ished nation it is , but there is no ex@@ cu@@ se to see that sort of squ@@ al@@ or .
of course , the real importance for bees is not the hon@@ ey .
we also have the swe@@ at bees , and these are little g@@ ems flying around .
it used to be , two , three hundred years ago , that a la@@ wn was a symbo@@ l of pres@@ ti@@ ge , and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually , des@@ er@@ ts : they &apos;re totally ster@@ ile .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so , okay , i &apos;m going to america .
well actually , you are going to wh@@ is@@ tle along .
okay . it &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
let &apos;s have a look at this nice code that is coming from a ren@@ aiss@@ ance book .
the blue wh@@ ale , it &apos;s a d@@ war@@ f if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is , this wonderful , mag@@ nific@@ ent se@@ quo@@ i@@ ad@@ end@@ ron gig@@ ant@@ eu@@ m .
but they are also able to sleep .
and in the last par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h of the book , it &apos;s a kind of sty@@ li@@ stic mark , because normally charles darwin sto@@ red , in the last par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h of a book , the most important message .
you can re@@ move 90 percent of the internet and it is &#91; continu@@ ing &#93; to work .
&lt; transcript &gt;
so at this point , she dec@@ ides to put the rap@@ e book away .
as i started taking impro@@ v class at the u@@ pri@@ ght citizens bri@@ ga@@ de theater and meeting other creative people and other per@@ form@@ ers and com@@ edi@@ ans , i started ama@@ ss@@ ing a mail@@ ing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects .
there &apos;s a better photo of it .
they &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
so i &apos;d say over the years , one of the most common cri@@ tic@@ is@@ ms i see of impro@@ v everywhere left anonym@@ ously on youtube comm@@ ents is : &quot; these people have too much time on their hands . &quot;
it &apos;s too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change , too expensive to impl@@ ement in all the places that require testing .
dan den@@ net@@ t &apos;s response to ri@@ ck war@@ ren
because i want to say that much the same thing is true of religions .
but also let them know about other religions .
i know many religions are so anxi@@ ous about pres@@ er@@ ving the pur@@ ity of their faith among their children that they are int@@ ent on keeping their children ignor@@ ant of other fai@@ ths .
franc@@ is cri@@ ck , the co-@@ disco@@ ver@@ er of the structure of dna with jim wat@@ son , once jo@@ ked about what he called org@@ el &apos;s second rule .
here &apos;s what he said .
i &apos;ll tell you what it is .
i &apos;ll give you a few quot@@ es .
and , the means -- how does he do it ?
now some of this is a difference of opinion , and that &apos;s not my main compl@@ aint .
but then i read on and i read this : &quot; first , no@@ ah had never seen rain , because pri@@ or to the flo@@ od god ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ated the earth from the ground up . &quot;
he &apos;s better at argu@@ ing than you are , having had thousands of years to practice . &quot;
if you are like me , you know many wonderful , commit@@ ted , engag@@ ed a@@ the@@ ists , agno@@ sti@@ cs , who are being very good without god .
whereas hearing is pas@@ sive , listening is something that we have to work at --
it looks a bit like this .
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a lou@@ d voice , it &apos;s too lou@@ d .
first of all , listen consci@@ ously .
i want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that , by far , most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light .
but if we were fre@@ ely falling through the space , even without this hel@@ p@@ ful grid , we might be able to paint it ourselves , because we would notice that we trav@@ eled along straight lines , un@@ de@@ fl@@ ected straight pa@@ ths through the universe .
it &apos;s actually not massive enough .
it would be like a near@@ -@@ death experience where you see the light at the end of the tun@@ nel , but it &apos;s a total death experience .
the sound you &apos;re hearing is the light black hole b@@ ang@@ ing on space each time it gets close .
but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
it gets closer and closer -- 4@@ 0,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing c@@ ave paint@@ ings .
n@@ al@@ in@@ i n@@ ad@@ kar@@ ni : life science in prison
of the 100 incar@@ cer@@ ated people that are rele@@ ased , 60 will return to prison .
but if trees can create art , if they can en@@ circle the globe seven times in one year , if pris@@ on@@ ers can grow plants and raise fro@@ gs , then perhaps there are other stati@@ c enti@@ ties that we hold inside ourselves , like gri@@ ef , like ad@@ dic@@ tions , like rac@@ ism , that can also change .
one has to discover a certain big@@ ness in on@@ es@@ el@@ f .
compassion is not defined in one form .
there &apos;s no choice in this :
to discover compassion , you need to be compas@@ sionate .
with these words , thank you very much .
we are there to inspire , to provo@@ ke , to mobi@@ li@@ ze , to bring hope to our people .
and i fell into a life in ex@@ ile .
these are some of the images and the characters of the film .
we can integr@@ ate over the surface , and the not@@ ation usually is a capital sig@@ ma .
they can just watch those videos . if they &apos;re bo@@ red , they can go ahead .
and then a few other things started to d@@ a@@ wn on me .
and the kh@@ an academ@@ y videos are there .
and they all fit together .
green means the student &apos;s already prof@@ ici@@ ent .
and we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rock@@ star team doing the software .
do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out ?
they don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
i see c@@ ats and dogs walking towards me . they come to a certain point and then stop .
but she was blind .
and in 17@@ 5@@ 9 , he described to his grand@@ son various things he was seeing .
the things you see can be very complicated indeed .
and these fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed her .
the charles b@@ onn@@ et ones are quite different .
so you may not only have &quot; car &quot; cells , you may have &quot; ast@@ on martin &quot; cells .
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucin@@ ations , but are too scar@@ ed to mention them .
ca : that was an ut@@ ter@@ ly , ut@@ ter@@ ly fascinating talk .
but just to try to prove that fact to you , i &apos;ve brought along some bi@@ olu@@ min@@ escent plan@@ k@@ ton in what is un@@ doub@@ ted@@ ly a fo@@ ol@@ har@@ dy attempt at a live demonstr@@ ation .
and you normally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve ex@@ hau@@ sted the lumin@@ escence when we bring them up in nets .
now if you po@@ ke it , it pul@@ ls in its tent@@ ac@@ les .
it &apos;s just 16 blue le@@ ds that we can program to do different types of dis@@ plays .
that &apos;s a 1@@ 2@@ -@@ foot@@ -@@ long giant six@@ g@@ ill shark .
thank you .
don &apos;t worry . many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathemati@@ cally sem@@ i-@@ liter@@ ate .
in sel@@ ecting a subject in which to condu@@ ct original research , or to develop worl@@ d-@@ class exper@@ tise , take a part of the cho@@ sen discipline that is s@@ par@@ sely in@@ hab@@ ited .
this first of the two strate@@ gies is like a hun@@ ter , explor@@ ing a forest in search of a particular qu@@ arry , who fin@@ ds other qu@@ arri@@ es along the way .
and this idea is actually nothing new .
and it &apos;s from x-@@ ray cr@@ y@@ st@@ allo@@ graph@@ y , so it &apos;s an accur@@ ate model of dna .
so to keep the dna organized and regu@@ late access to the genetic code , it &apos;s wr@@ apped around these pur@@ ple proteins -- or i &apos;ve lab@@ eled them pur@@ ple here .
so this is a single chromosome .
so with a little bit of molecular eye c@@ and@@ y , we &apos;ve got kin@@ es@@ ins , which are the orange ones .
the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive .
and in the man@@ y-@@ to-@@ many era , every des@@ k@@ top is now a print@@ ing press , a broad@@ ca@@ sting station , a community or a mark@@ et@@ place .
they will not play the game again , they don &apos;t know each other ,
principles , and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don &apos;t work .
e@@ bay solved the pris@@ on@@ er &apos;s dilem@@ ma and created a market where none would have exis@@ ted by creating a feedback mechan@@ ism that turns a pris@@ on@@ er &apos;s dilem@@ ma game into an assur@@ ance game .
what forms of suffering could be all@@ ev@@ i@@ ated , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about co@@ operation ?
these little green bu@@ b@@ bles represent photo@@ syn@@ ths that users have made .

and that &apos;s cur@@ tis w@@ ong , worldwide telescope .
the kh@@ mer rouge clo@@ ses the do@@ ors to the outside world .
and she decided , despite the ad@@ vice of her neighbors , that she would take the chance and claim to be viet@@ nam@@ ese so that we could have a chance to survive ,
and i got word last month that the compl@@ aint was offici@@ ally accep@@ ted by the kh@@ mer rouge tribu@@ n@@ al .
one day a man told me , &quot; my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . &quot;
and the af@@ gh@@ an sense of the future is sh@@ at@@ tered .
and they are working with me up to today .
but now i know , because i am part of a nucl@@ eus of a new pe@@ ac@@ eful society in afghanistan . &quot;
in its essence , the orches@@ tra and the cho@@ ir are much more than arti@@ stic structures . they are examples and schools of social life , because to sing and to play together means to in@@ timately co@@ exist toward perf@@ ection and excell@@ ence , following a stric@@ t discipline of organization and coordin@@ ation in order to see@@ k the harmon@@ ic inter@@ depend@@ ence
all this makes up a construc@@ tive and as@@ c@@ ending social dynamic .

you have to just do it twice , you have to touch the screen and then rot@@ ate your finger slightly --
now , imagine a screen , which is not only tou@@ ch@@ -@@ sensitive now , it &apos;s pres@@ su@@ re-@@ sensitive .
fil@@ m@@ makers , for example , are the experts in mono@@ logue making :
narr@@ ator : when i find a chap@@ ter that i want to see , i just touch the text and the system will form@@ at pages for me to read .
we did it in some pretty r@@ ough areas of new york city .
the child read beauti@@ fully , it turned out , and was really very comp@@ et@@ ent . so it actually meant something .
but ro@@ ot@@ ed in that , little did she know how much knowledge she was acqu@@ ir@@ ing about ge@@ om@@ etry and just math and logic and all the rest .
now , we track , on the person &apos;s head , the head mo@@ tions --
all right ? very big differences between the way i ans@@ wer@@ ed the phone the three times .
this is some of the field work that we &apos;ve done .
the first bo@@ om@@ er actually , we didn &apos;t even wait ti@@ ll 20@@ 11 , next year .
we have to shift from this ma@@ infr@@ ame ment@@ ality of health@@ care to a personal model of health@@ care .
this is what was happening to mim@@ i ; the family was worried about it , moved her out of her own home into an ass@@ is@@ ted living facilit@@ y .
that &apos;s sort of the state of the art .
so , 10,000 house@@ holds or bu@@ st .
the job of un@@ co@@ vering the global food waste sc@@ and@@ al started for me when i was 15 years old .
any do@@ t above that line , and you &apos;ll quickly notice that that inclu@@ des most countries in the world , represents un@@ necessary sur@@ plus , and is likely to refl@@ ect levels of waste in each country .
that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields .
off the market shel@@ ves that hun@@ gry people de@@ pend on .
the one on the right i treated like cut f@@ lowers .
ren@@ ow@@ ned pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logist jack hor@@ ner has spent his career trying to re@@ constru@@ ct a dinosau@@ r . he &apos;s found fo@@ ss@@ ils with extraordin@@ arily well-@@ pres@@ er@@ ved blood v@@ ess@@ els and soft tis@@ su@@ es , but never int@@ act dna . so , in a new approach , he &apos;s taking living descend@@ ants of the dinosau@@ r and gene@@ tically engineering them to re@@ activ@@ ate anc@@ es@@ tr@@ al traits — including teeth , tail@@ s , and even hands — to make a &quot; chic@@ ken@@ osau@@ rus &quot; .
we have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were ju@@ ven@@ iles to when they were adults .
back in 199@@ 3 when the movie came out , we actually had a gr@@ ant from the national science foundation to attempt to extr@@ act dna from a dinosau@@ r ,
we gave sam@@ ples to mary sch@@ we@@ it@@ z@@ er , and she was actually able to deter@@ mine that b@@ -@@ re@@ x was a female based on me@@ du@@ l@@ lar@@ y tissue found on the inside of the bone .
so the non-@@ av@@ ian dinosaurs are the big cl@@ un@@ ky ones that went ext@@ inct .
you take a g@@ low gene out of a coral or a j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish and you stick it in a z@@ ebr@@ af@@ ish , and , pu@@ ff , they g@@ low .
and i said , &quot; well , if you can find those , i can just reverse them and make what i need to make for the six@@ th-@@ grad@@ ers . &quot;
well , that &apos;s a good question .
if they had some extra band@@ wid@@ th , they would deliver a message for you .
what they &apos;ll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the ir@@ an@@ ian nuclear facilit@@ y .
and so even a modern ro@@ cket ship these days actually uses internet proto@@ co@@ l to talk from one end of the ro@@ cket ship to the other .
and so i think that this is actually , of all the problems you &apos;re going to hear about at the conference , this is probably one of the very ea@@ si@@ est to fix .
there &apos;re some very deli@@ ght@@ ful names .
&quot; no , no , really , i &apos;m so bu@@ sy with the stars .
&quot; now , frank is this clear to you , d@@ j@@ ab@@ ran flu@@ ctu@@ s ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , go to your room . &quot;
which is not to be conf@@ used with the five sac@@ red sal@@ ads .
so , maps of things leading to organized underst@@ and@@ ings of the universe in which we emer@@ ge . now this is is@@ a@@ ac from a viet@@ nam@@ ese st@@ amp .
this is , of course , the car@@ tes@@ ian coordin@@ ates .
i know that scar@@ es a lot of you , but that was my purpose entirely .
there is so many in@@ tric@@ ate relationships that i &apos;m not going to go there now , because you would say , &quot; hey , go back to the flu@@ ctu@@ s part . &quot;
un@@ believ@@ able . this is like crazy .
gu@@ y-@@ phili@@ ppe gol@@ d@@ ste@@ in : how cyber@@ att@@ acks thre@@ aten re@@ al-@@ world peace
it gets even more complicated when the doc@@ tr@@ ines of use become ambi@@ gu@@ ous .
but in doing so , they also add their own risk of trig@@ ger@@ ing a conflict -- as we &apos;ve just seen , a very important risk -- and a risk we may have to con@@ front with a collective security solution which inclu@@ des all of us : european alli@@ es , na@@ to members , our american friends and alli@@ es , our other western alli@@ es , and maybe , by forc@@ ing their hand a little , our russi@@ an and chinese partners .
this is what i saw . i saw h@@ ills and val@@ le@@ ys .
so , what i &apos;d like to do now is try a little drawing .
try and infl@@ ate it .
for instance , i took them ski@@ ing in the mi@@ d-@@ atlan@@ tic range , which is this range of mountains in the middle of the atlan@@ tic .
the third story@@ line i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult .
thanks .
and that &apos;s what i hope my com@@ ic stri@@ p does in a small way .

this is a book of cal@@ end@@ ars , and i &apos;ll ask -- who was it that wanted to know their birth day ? you sir ? ok .
but to make my job more interesting for you , as well as for me , i &apos;m going to do this problem thinking out lou@@ d .
there &apos;s definitely a method to my ma@@ dness -- definitely , definitely . sorry .
first off , my bad@@ ge says i &apos;m an astronom@@ er .
in fact , i think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a techno@@ logist , a scientist , a physi@@ cist .
if you take two mobi@@ us lo@@ ops and se@@ w their common edge together , you get one of these , and i make them out of glass .
we &apos;re studying physics , i &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; that &apos;s a good thing to do .
is true . is true . i teach ei@@ gh@@ th-@@ grade science four days a week .
and there &apos;s no time to do it .
so , i &apos;ll put a measur@@ ing tape here , measur@@ ing tape here , move it back over to here .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; i got to clear out of here ! &quot;
it is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot;
by buying a space that was 4@@ 20 s@@ q@@ . f@@ t@@ . instead of 600 , immediately i &apos;m saving 200 grand .
my bed just po@@ ps out of the wall with two fingers .
you see any adults ?
and it is a mar@@ vel@@ ous example of how a differ@@ enti@@ al in power can be over@@ ri@@ dden by a process of nature that &apos;s within all of us .
and there &apos;s a whole other type of play , which is object play .
pres@@ cho@@ ol kids , for example , should be allowed to di@@ ve , hit , wh@@ is@@ tle , scre@@ am , be cha@@ o@@ tic , and develop through that a lot of emotional regul@@ ation and a lot of the other social by@@ products -- cognitive , emotional and physical -- that come as a part of r@@ ough and tum@@ ble play .
i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t have a play@@ ful@@ -@@ looking subject , but it allows mo@@ bility , which has limited the actual study of play .
the basis of human trust is estab@@ li@@ shed through play signals .
at least in public .
an important key insi@@ ght that we learned about me@@ et@@ ings is that people pack them in one after another , dis@@ rup@@ tive to the day .
and its hu@@ g@@ ely important in learning and cr@@ af@@ ting the brain .
the champ@@ agne grap@@ es that you see are actually car@@ bon@@ ated grap@@ es . a little bit of s@@ ea@@ food and some cr@@ ème f@@ rai@@ che and the picture actually ta@@ stes exactly like the dish .
and basically the reaction t@@ ends to be kind of like this .
i told the staff , let &apos;s just take a bunch of wild plants , think of them as food ingre@@ dients . as long as they &apos;re non-@@ pois@@ on@@ ous to the human body , go out around chicago si@@ de@@ wal@@ ks , take it , bl@@ end it , co@@ ok it and then have everybody fl@@ av@@ or@@ -@@ trip on it at mo@@ to .
and when we take out the u.s. and look at the re@@ main@@ ing 21 percent , we see a lot of iraq -- that &apos;s that big green thing there -- and little else .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so if we &apos;re going to study viral ch@@ at@@ ter , we need to get to these populations who have inten@@ sive contact with wild animals .
these individuals are at specific risk , particularly if there &apos;s blood contact , they &apos;re at risk for transmission and possibly infection with nov@@ el viruses .
so , in 199@@ 8 , along with my ment@@ ors don bur@@ ke and colon@@ el m@@ pou@@ di@@ -@@ n@@ go@@ le , we went to actually start this work in central africa , to work with hun@@ ters in this part of the world .
early on , in order to ship our spec@@ im@@ ens , we had to have dry ice . to get dry ice we had to go to the bre@@ wer@@ ies -- be@@ g , bor@@ row , st@@ eal to get these folks to give it to us .
it had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves , and thought about ourselves .
i want people to discover themselves as actors , as creative actors , by having interactive experiences .
and he said one of them is called mal@@ u@@ ma .
and it &apos;s almost impossible to per@@ form .
and so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects .
and i &apos;m going to show a video of the older version of it , which is just a minute long . okay .
those are its t@@ arg@@ ets .
and in my case , when i hit send , up to 6@@ 0,000 people will rece@@ ive that message in a matter of seconds .
oh ... &quot; ev@@ an willi@@ ams is just dying on stage here at ted .
and for many years after@@ wards , i would have a des@@ per@@ ate desire to taste g@@ ing@@ er be@@ er .
and his mother showed us a beauti@@ fully patter@@ ned bas@@ k@@ et made of dy@@ ed ra@@ ff@@ ia that his brother had made .
the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from l@@ agos two days ago , in which there was an announ@@ cement on the vir@@ gin flight about the char@@ ity work in &quot; india , africa and other countries . &quot;
there were end@@ less stories of mexic@@ ans as people who were fle@@ ec@@ ing the health@@ care system , sn@@ ea@@ king across the bor@@ der , being ar@@ res@@ ted at the bor@@ der , that sort of thing .
but the truth is that i had a very happy childhood , full of lau@@ ghter and love , in a very clo@@ se-@@ k@@ n@@ it family .
what the nigeri@@ an writer chin@@ u@@ a ach@@ e@@ be calls &quot; a balance of stories . &quot;
and it is amazing to me how many people apply , how many people are e@@ ager to write , to tell stories .
and i am sitting by my father &apos;s be@@ d@@ side in hospital , trying to work out whether i should let him drink the one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ li@@ ter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said , &quot; you must make him drink today , &quot; -- my father &apos;s been n@@ il by mouth for a week -- or whether , by giving him this bottle , i might actually kill him .
so in order to help you understand where i &apos;m coming from , let me bring you into my world , the world of experts .
it recently came out that experts tri@@ aling drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first , prim@@ arily on male animals and then , prim@@ arily on men .
thank you .
so we &apos;re b@@ ound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
you don &apos;t do it as a human being . you do it as a machine .
nobody wants to buy a min@@ i well when they buy a car .
that &apos;s how i solved it in my head . it was a white paper i hand@@ ed out to governments .
so if you want to buy a g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine car in den@@ mark , it costs you about 6@@ 0,000 euro@@ s .
so the price of oil , much like lots of other cur@@ ves that we &apos;ve seen , goes along a de@@ ple@@ tion curve .
that is 0@@ .@@ 5 percent of the u.s. oil consumption .
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
and when we go to cop@@ 15 at the end of this year
and the industrial revolution started within less than one year .
the war is so wor@@ rying at present , with court cases coming up in one state after another , that i felt i had to say something about it .
but that &apos;s putting it too neg@@ atively .
he begins by expl@@ aining how science works through the testing of hypo@@ thes@@ es that are fram@@ ed to be vulnerable to dis@@ pro@@ of , and then he goes on .
&quot; no , i don &apos;t know that a@@ the@@ ists should be considered citizens , nor should they be considered patri@@ ots .
why does this far more subst@@ anti@@ al min@@ ority not make a move to exercise its political muscle ?
in most cases , people who out themselves will help to destro@@ y the my@@ th that there is something wrong with a@@ the@@ ists .
now , a friend , an intelligent lap@@ sed je@@ w , who inci@@ dent@@ ally obser@@ ved the s@@ ab@@ bat@@ h for reasons of cultural soli@@ dar@@ ity , descri@@ bes himself as a &quot; to@@ oth fai@@ ry agno@@ stic . &quot;
&quot; non-@@ the@@ ist &quot; will do for all that , yet unlike &quot; a@@ the@@ ist , &quot; it doesn &apos;t have the same pho@@ bi@@ c , hy@@ st@@ eri@@ cal respon@@ ses .
thank you very much , chris . everybody who came up here said they were scar@@ ed . i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m scar@@ ed , but this is my first time of ad@@ dr@@ essing an audience like this .
and that succ@@ esses are being chal@@ ked up on this very important fight .
one in four sub-@@ sahar@@ an afri@@ cans is nigeri@@ an , and it has 1@@ 40 million dynamic people -- cha@@ o@@ tic people -- but very interesting people . you &apos;ll never be bo@@ red .
the other thing we &apos;ve also done is to manage our fin@@ ances better .
and now , we have a situation in which the businesses in this m@@ all are doing four times the tur@@ no@@ ver that they had proj@@ ected .
and i want to just make one point about this investment .
think about the bea@@ trices , think about the ad@@ en@@ i@@ kes of this world , who are doing incredible things , that are bringing them into the global economy , wh@@ il@@ st at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employ@@ ed , and that the children in those house@@ holds get educ@@ ated because their parents are ear@@ ning a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate income .
the japanese had , for the first time , created the fa@@ st@@ est super@@ computer -- the ne@@ c earth simul@@ ator -- taking the primary from the u.s. , and about two years later -- this , by the way , is measur@@ ing the trillion flo@@ at@@ ing@@ -@@ point oper@@ ations per second that the computer &apos;s capable of running --
another por@@ tion is not only how content is produced , but how relev@@ ance is produced .
but what we &apos;re seeing now is the emer@@ gence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange .
you build plat@@ forms for self-@@ expression and collaboration .
a few years ago , professor vac@@ la@@ v sm@@ il tried to calcul@@ ate the prob@@ ability of sudden dis@@ ast@@ ers large enough to change history .
or polio ? how many of you remember the ir@@ on lun@@ g ?
by that time , the bat@@ tle against hiv would already have been lost .
and it quickly hi@@ des itself in your genome .
this strategy , working back@@ wards
so if this works in humans , what we &apos;re talking about is a universal flu vaccine , one that doesn &apos;t need to change every year and would re@@ move the threat of death .
and we can up that to about 1.@@ 2 billion do@@ ses if we want to target a single vari@@ ant like sw@@ ine flu .
so if we have the political and financial for@@ es@@ ight to sust@@ ain our invest@@ ments , we will master these and new tools of vaccin@@ ology ,
ca : and malaria &apos;s even further behind ?
the hi@@ pp@@ o generation are the r@@ ul@@ ing el@@ ites . they are stuck in their intellectual pat@@ ch . compl@@ aining about colon@@ i@@ alism and im@@ peri@@ alism , they wouldn &apos;t move one foot .
capital flight out of africa , 80 billion a year .
the second fal@@ se pre@@ mise that we make when we &apos;re trying to help africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in africa that car@@ es about its people , ser@@ ves the interests of the people , and represents the people .
more than 80 percent of iv@@ ory coast &apos;s development went into the modern sector .
in the economic system in traditional africa , the means of production is priv@@ ately ow@@ ned .
that is not the kind of system afri@@ cans had known for cent@@ u@@ ries .
ste@@ war@@ t brand on s@@ quat@@ ter cities
that &apos;s the news from down@@ town . here it is in perspective .
they dis@@ appeared .
so i do think this is a problem .
and the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society .
and i say that sin@@ cer@@ ely , part@@ ly because -- -- i need that ! put y@@ ourselves in my position !
and i looked and there was a man running across the run@@ way .
cars and tru@@ cks -- i talked about that in the sli@@ des@@ how , but i want you to put it in perspective .
the movie comes out -- the movie is a movie version of the sli@@ des@@ how i gave two ni@@ ghts ago , except it &apos;s a lot more entertain@@ ing . and it comes out in may .
you have more influence than some of us who are democr@@ ats do .
we &apos;re warming the climate .
it &apos;s really mess@@ y .
i think it &apos;s being hidden on purpose .
now , in the ex@@ x@@ on val@@ dez sp@@ ill , about 30 percent of the kill@@ er wh@@ ales died in the first few months .
there are a lot of birds in the gulf that concentr@@ ate in the gulf at certain times of the year , but then leave .
there are hundreds of sh@@ ri@@ mp bo@@ ats employ@@ ed to dra@@ g bo@@ oms instead of nets .
now there are things that we can do in the future .
we &apos;re either going to have an absolutely un@@ mi@@ ti@@ g@@ ated catastrophe of this oil lea@@ k in the gulf , or we will make the moment we need out of this , as many people have not@@ ed today .
our genes seem to have aw@@ es@@ ome power over our destin@@ ies .
there &apos;s a diag@@ ram like this for your brain , but there &apos;s no way it would fit on this slide .
and still , you may not see the bran@@ ches .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a guy or girl , everyone &apos;s brains are like sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti .
and some day , artifici@@ ally intelligent super@@ computers will analy@@ ze the images without human ass@@ istance to sum@@ mar@@ ize them in a connect@@ ome .
and it might true that just the m@@ ere act of thinking can change your connect@@ ome -- an idea that you may find em@@ power@@ ing .
because , if the first neurons in the chain are activ@@ ated , through their syn@@ ap@@ ses they send messages to the second neurons , which are activ@@ ated , and so on down the line , like a chain of falling domin@@ o@@ es .
one of their most cher@@ ished dreams is to che@@ at death by that practice known as cr@@ y@@ on@@ ics .
we investi@@ gate materials and technologies that have un@@ expected properties . over the last three years , we found over 200 of these things , and so we looked back into our library and sel@@ ected six we thought would be most surprising for ted .
because the way that he present@@ ed the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours . he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now .
and i have it right here in my po@@ cket .
z@@ k : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target .
while he was doing this , he noticed an un@@ expected thing .
z@@ k : now , this technology was developed by these two guys : professor ken su@@ sli@@ ck and ne@@ il ra@@ ko@@ w , of the university of ill@@ in@@ ois .
and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said , &quot; look , hydro@@ pho@@ bi@@ c string . &quot;
can we produce a men@@ u that &apos;s del@@ icious without foie gras ?
&quot; sp@@ an@@ ish chef acc@@ used of che@@ ating . &quot;
he &apos;s really just in love with -- he &apos;s at one with -- he &apos;s the goo@@ se wh@@ is@@ per@@ er .
he electri@@ fi@@ es only the outside .
they get what they want , they leave the rest for me and i sell it .
and we &apos;re sitting there , and i hear &#91; cl@@ apping &#93; from a distance , so i look over .
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
and i &apos;m not like some super ta@@ ster , you know ?
and as he said , i think f@@ it@@ t@@ ingly , it &apos;s a gi@@ ft from god , with god saying , you &apos;ve done good work .
the ph@@ ar@@ a@@ oh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .
he said , &quot; if all the insects dis@@ appeared , life on earth as we know it would dis@@ appear within 50 years .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the dem@@ o .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paint@@ ings , &quot; the harv@@ es@@ ters &quot; by pi@@ eter bru@@ eg@@ el at the met .
so another one of my favor@@ ites , &quot; the star@@ ry night . &quot;
thank you .
after , there is people like me , who try to des@@ erve to exist , and who are so ash@@ am@@ ed to make this us@@ eless job , who try to do it in another way , and they try , i try , to not make the object for the object but for the result , for the profit for the human being , the person who will use it .
after , we become a fish ; after , we become a fro@@ g ; after , we become a monkey ; after , we become what we are today : a super-@@ monkey , and the fun is , the super-@@ monkey we are today , is at half of the story .
i can explain you . i shall try .
come back . because , after , there is another tra@@ p .
because it &apos;s not , the bar@@ b@@ aria we have today , it &apos;s perhaps not the bar@@ b@@ aria we think .
and the beauty of this , in perhaps 50 years , 60 years , we can finish completely this civilization ,
in fact , they have more control over the loss of control than ever before .
take the travel service n@@ ext@@ pe@@ dition .
no one was a hero . no one was a hero .
and that psycho@@ logical barri@@ er of fear had worked for so many years , and here comes the internet , technology , black@@ ber@@ ry , s@@ ms .
because of the internet , the truth prev@@ ailed and everyone knew the truth .
everything was done by the people to the people , and that &apos;s the power of the internet .
all the ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pes that the regi@@ me was trying to put on us through their so@@ -@@ called propag@@ anda , or ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am media , are pro@@ ven wrong .
i want you to take a look at this baby .
well , babies all over the world are what i like to describe as &quot; citizens of the world . &quot; they can dis@@ crimin@@ ate all the sounds of all languages , no matter what country we &apos;re testing and what language we &apos;re using ,
it &apos;s rais@@ ing lots of questions about bil@@ in@@ gu@@ al people .
the social brain is control@@ ling when the babies are taking their statistics .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and we run clin@@ ics in these very remote regi@@ ons where there &apos;s no medical care what@@ so@@ ever .
and i realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience , from working with dying people and training care@@ gi@@ vers , that any atta@@ ch@@ ment to out@@ come would dis@@ tort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe .
but compassion , the generation of compassion , actually mobi@@ liz@@ es our immun@@ ity .
he sees that the dog has this big w@@ ound on its leg .
because if you only have the ir@@ an@@ ian pass@@ port , you &apos;re kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms , you know -- sy@@ ri@@ a , ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela , north kore@@ a .
but as you can see , when i talk , i speak with an american ac@@ cent , which you would think as an ir@@ ani@@ an-@@ american actor , i should be able to play any part , good , bad , what have you .
and one thing that happened there was also the pak@@ ist@@ an@@ i tal@@ i@@ ban took credit for that failed car bomb@@ ing .
he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going to the zar@@ a store . it &apos;s three miles away .
and i for@@ got there &apos;s obviously successful indi@@ ans in du@@ b@@ ai as well .
he had this wonderful trick where a ro@@ se@@ bush would b@@ loo@@ m right in front of your eyes .
announ@@ cer : one five will get you 10 , 10 will get you 20 .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so , this is exactly what i did .
so , because i am a trained econom@@ ist and i think in economic terms , all of the sudden i thought , maybe there is something here .
now , again we see a mix of legal and il@@ legal acti@@ vities .
this is about twice the gdp of the united king@@ dom , soon will be more , consider@@ ing where this country is going .
and it is , in fact , an anti-@@ mon@@ ey@@ -@@ laun@@ der@@ ing leg@@ is@@ lation .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
i thought there were them and there were us , and i was not one of them .
but what can you do ? you &apos;re in the middle of the ocean . o@@ ars are your only means of propul@@ sion .
question number two : how do you sleep ?
and to row in a straight line across it would be about 8@@ ,000 miles .
but it doesn &apos;t re@@ act very well to being immer@@ sed in ocean , which is what happened to it .
it &apos;s that little green sli@@ ver on the horizon ,
the second point is about the accumul@@ ation of tiny actions .
we just want to try and create that awar@@ eness because , sure , changing a light bul@@ b isn &apos;t going to change the world , but that attitude , that awar@@ eness that leads you to change the light bul@@ b or take your re@@ us@@ able coffee mu@@ g , that is what could change the world .
and i think that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to talk about today .
now , i don &apos;t know what you think , but i think this is a pretty stupid decision , because what you &apos;ve done is just made a perman@@ ent mem@@ ori@@ al to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever .
does everybody know what a camera obs@@ cur@@ a is ?
and they said , well , it &apos;s summer , what do you do ?
here we &apos;re going to walk across the bridge at night . it &apos;s self-@@ lit , you don &apos;t need any over@@ head ligh@@ ting , so the neighbors don &apos;t compl@@ ain about met@@ al-@@ hal@@ ide ligh@@ ting in their face .
this is a win@@ e-@@ buying experience simpli@@ fied by color and taste . fi@@ zz@@ y , fresh , soft , l@@ us@@ ci@@ ous , ju@@ ic@@ y , smo@@ oth , big and sweet w@@ ines , all explained to you by color and tex@@ ture on the wall . and finally , it &apos;s about entertainment , as in his head@@ quar@@ ters for the cir@@ que du soleil , or@@ lan@@ do , flor@@ id@@ a , where you &apos;re asked to enter the gre@@ ek theater , look under the tent and join the magic world of cir@@ que du soleil .
b@@ har@@ ti see@@ ks to liber@@ ate this everyday cli@@ che , as she calls it , by explo@@ ding it into something spectac@@ ular .
he creates these op@@ ul@@ ent tab@@ le@@ au@@ s inspired by hi@@ er@@ on@@ ym@@ us bos@@ ch , but also by the k@@ ash@@ mi@@ ri tex@@ tiles of his you@@ th .
and we can viol@@ ate your expect@@ ations in a whole variety of ways about represent@@ ation , about shape , about color and so forth and it &apos;s very pr@@ ima@@ l . and
ok now . ar@@ thu@@ r &#91; g@@ ans@@ on &#93; hasn &apos;t talked yet , but his is going to be a deli@@ ght@@ ful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside . and so , we -- scot@@ t created this wonderful tribu@@ te to ar@@ thu@@ r g@@ ans@@ on .
do you ever feel completely overwhel@@ med when you &apos;re fac@@ ed with a complex problem ?
well , when i saw this in the front page of the times , i thought , &quot; great . finally something i can relate to .
it &apos;s true .
what i do is i write books about the cultural history of physics .
the fr@@ il@@ ly cr@@ en@@ ul@@ ated forms that you see in cor@@ als , and kel@@ ps , and spon@@ ges and nu@@ di@@ bran@@ ch@@ s , is a form of ge@@ om@@ etry known as hyper@@ bo@@ lic ge@@ om@@ etry .
i ask the question , how many lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line ? &quot; and you all know the answer . does someone want to sh@@ out it out ?
this is the drawing .
their answer was interesting .
which is where i first learned about hyper@@ bo@@ lic space .
well , there are many ways of appro@@ ach@@ ing the fun@@ ctions of the human brain .
and then , as you grow up , the cortex develop@@ s , and in@@ hi@@ bits these lat@@ ent sexu@@ al ur@@ ges towards your mother .
which you can completely igno@@ re .
by the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an ad@@ jac@@ ent room -- phones him -- and he pic@@ ks up the phone , and he says , &quot; wow , mom , how are you ? where are you ? &quot; there &apos;s no del@@ usion through the phone .
it &apos;s fix@@ ed in a cl@@ en@@ ched sp@@ as@@ m and it &apos;s ex@@ cruci@@ at@@ ingly pa@@ in@@ ful .
ok ? what you do is you create what i call a mirror box .
maybe , after a period of practice , you can dis@@ pense with the mirror , un@@ learn the paraly@@ sis , and start moving your paraly@@ zed arm , and then , reli@@ eve yourself of pain . &quot; so he said ok , and he took it home .
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other resp@@ ects .
why would there be cross@@ ed wi@@ res in some people ?
how many of you think that &apos;s bu@@ ba , that &apos;s ki@@ ki ? raise your hands .
so that &apos;s another project for nasa .
that &apos;s a challenge for 21@@ st-@@ century science .
we de@@ pend on chemistry to deter@@ mine our complex structure .
in fact , some years ago , bill joy wrote an article ex@@ pr@@ essing tremendous concer@@ n about robots taking us over , etc .
there &apos;s an un@@ thinking tend@@ ency to imagine that humans will be there , experi@@ encing the sun &apos;s dem@@ ise , but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria .
met@@ alli@@ c objects -- al@@ be@@ it very small ones , a few tons at most -- es@@ cap@@ ed into or@@ bit around the earth .
and it &apos;s used for communication .
and she came to us when she was just at pu@@ ber@@ ty , about six or seven years of age .
video : look at all this stuff that &apos;s here for our camp@@ fire .
this is her first time to try to drive a golf car@@ t .
k@@ anz@@ i &apos;s rock is from gon@@ a , ethiop@@ ia and is identi@@ cal to that used by our african ancest@@ ors two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half million years ago .
video : this l@@ exi@@ gram also re@@ f@@ ers to a place in the wo@@ ods .
do that real fast part that you did . yeah , that part .
tim ber@@ ner@@ s-@@ lee : the year open data went worldwide
how can you use this stuff ?
this is a re@@ al-@@ time map that shows blo@@ cked roads , dama@@ ged buildings , refu@@ ge@@ e cam@@ ps --
it explo@@ ded an arms race .
do you think you could do it ? i would like to see if this audience would -- no , you haven &apos;t pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ed , as far as i know -- can you get it together to cl@@ ap in syn@@ c ?
let me be quiet for a second because this is so gor@@ ge@@ ous .
even though it looks like they &apos;re thinking as a group , they &apos;re not .
the trees , mang@@ ro@@ ve trees , are filled with fi@@ re@@ flies communic@@ ating with light .
if you have e@@ pil@@ ep@@ sy , there is an instance of billions of brain cells , or at least millions , dis@@ char@@ ging in patho@@ logical concert .
i also want to wind this one up a bit . how can they communicate ?
intervie@@ wer : not up and down ? boy : no .
and especially if we start to walk like those people did , right ?
just by walking . intervie@@ wer : well , it &apos;s certainly going now .
and he described the diversity within cro@@ ps -- all the different kinds of whe@@ at and rice and such -- as a genetic resource .
and i want to give you an example of that .
and there are a couple of answers to that question .
the agri@@ cultural system and , more importantly , the cro@@ ps in the field in india have never experienced this before .
it &apos;s as far as you can fly on a regu@@ lar@@ ly s@@ che@@ du@@ led airplane .
this is a back@@ up system for world agriculture . it &apos;s a back@@ up system for all the seed ban@@ ks . stor@@ age is free .
but right now i would say we don &apos;t have a card cat@@ alo@@ g for it .
when working on laptop . however , they will adop@@ t a less natural pos@@ ture in order to balance it on their lap@@ s ,
and this research is being preci@@ pit@@ ated by the u.s. government ,
they need to look forward to exploration ; they need to look forward to colon@@ ization ; they need to look forward to break@@ through@@ s .
the j@@ et age started : the mis@@ si@@ le age started . v@@ on br@@ au@@ n was on there showing how to go to mars -- and this was before s@@ put@@ ni@@ k .
you know , a good example , of course , is the dar@@ pa net .
oh , it &apos;s going to be so much fun .
but something is out there to inspire our kids now .
but anyway , i think we need to beat them again .
end to end , that would form a line that would circle the earth twice .
and on the other end , exc@@ essive angiogen@@ es@@ is -- too many blood v@@ ess@@ els -- dri@@ ves disease ,
and once those v@@ ess@@ els inv@@ ade the cancer , it can exp@@ and , it can inv@@ ade local tis@@ su@@ es .
here &apos;s a cancer growing on the li@@ p of a w@@ u@@ ar@@ ter horse named gu@@ in@@ ness .
our search for this has taken us to the market , the farm and to the sp@@ ice ca@@ bin@@ et , because what we &apos;ve discovered is that mother nature has l@@ ac@@ ed a large number of fo@@ ods and b@@ ever@@ ages and her@@ bs with naturally occur@@ ring in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of angiogen@@ es@@ is .
and here are the di@@ et@@ ary fac@@ tors going head to head against these drugs .
stop the treatment , ga@@ ins the weight back .
w@@ l : well , you know , there &apos;s ab@@ un@@ dant epidem@@ i@@ o@@ logical evidence .
one h@@ int : it &apos;s not &quot; l@@ . &quot;
it &apos;s a very small form , like a joke , a po@@ em , a magic trick or a song , very comp@@ act form .
here &apos;s the word &quot; mirror . &quot; no , it &apos;s not the same up@@ si@@ de-@@ down . it &apos;s the same this way .
it &apos;s made by the company think fun .
cut up the dna , you sequence individual pieces , and then you look for over@@ lap@@ s ,
well , guess what ? that &apos;s changing .
but if you can see it , sh@@ out out the answer .
i want you to imagine that the girl is a chi@@ p in the huge mac@@ ro@@ cos@@ m of collective consciousness .
i went and i spent time in a place called bu@@ k@@ av@@ u in a hospital called the pan@@ z@@ i hospital , with a doctor who was as close to a s@@ aint as any person i &apos;ve ever met .
to pre@@ tend they &apos;re not a m@@ ess when they are a m@@ ess .
girls are trained to please .
and through her self-@@ defen@@ se , she gr@@ ab@@ bed their adam &apos;s app@@ les , she pun@@ ched them in the eyes and she got her@@ self free and out of the car .
she imagin@@ ed her father killing her on one hand , and ma@@ ma agnes gre@@ eting her , with the hope that she would gre@@ et her when she got to the house .
i can feel what you &apos;re feeling as you &apos;re feeling inside the feeling before .
and you know what ? sometimes it should .
and if he does this an infin@@ ite number of times , which you can do in mathematics , he ends up with an infin@@ ite number of lines , each of which has an infin@@ ite number of points in it .
they were brea@@ thing those words with fr@@ act@@ al lun@@ gs .
i came up with this structure here .
second , you might ask , &quot; well , dr. e@@ gl@@ ash , aren &apos;t you ignor@@ ing the diversity of african cultures ? &quot; and three times , the answer is no .
here &apos;s a wonderful fr@@ act@@ al .
so even plus od@@ d gives you od@@ d .
we &apos;ve also been working in design .
what i have here is a cin@@ der block that we &apos;ve co@@ ated half with a nan@@ otechno@@ logy spr@@ ay that can be applied to almost any material .
you &apos;d think it &apos;d be smo@@ oth , but it &apos;s actually not .
two ted favor@@ ites , j@@ ill so@@ bu@@ le and juli@@ a swe@@ en@@ ey , team up for a deli@@ ght@@ ful set that mix@@ es wit@@ ty son@@ g@@ writing with a little bit of social comment@@ ary .
it makes &quot; what the ble@@ ep do we know &quot; seem like a doc@@ tor@@ al dis@@ ser@@ tation from harvard on quantum mechan@@ ics -- that &apos;s how bad it is .
or think about the fact that if you build an automobile , i &apos;ll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile .
because it &apos;s very interesting . when you take this model and you per@@ tur@@ b it , you give it a push , as it bu@@ mps into something , it self-@@ stabi@@ liz@@ es , with no brain or no refl@@ ex@@ es , just by the structure alone .
it actually le@@ aps into the air , and has a@@ eri@@ al ph@@ ases when it does it , like a horse , and you &apos;ll see it &apos;s boun@@ cing here .
we have one here and notice its position . it &apos;s holding on .
here are the robots that they inspire , the me@@ cho@@ -@@ g@@ ec@@ k@@ os from i@@ robot .
they don &apos;t have any glu@@ e , and they even stick under water just fine .
and it was invented in 18@@ 5@@ 8 , by this guy fer@@ din@@ and car@@ re , but he couldn &apos;t actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time .
we think we can build these in high volu@@ mes for about 25 dollars , in low volu@@ mes for about 40 dollars .
and i realized he doesn &apos;t know where the women &apos;s room is in his office .
so i &apos;m not saying that st@@ aying in the work@@ force is the right thing for everyone .
&quot; you got the top grade in the class ?
and she &apos;s an oper@@ ator in a company in silicon valley , and she uses her cont@@ acts to become a very successful v@@ enture capit@@ alist .
she said , &quot; well , you &apos;re giving this talk , and you said you were going to take two more questions .
here &apos;s what happens : we &apos;re all bu@@ sy . everyone &apos;s bu@@ sy . a woman &apos;s bu@@ sy .
we are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population -- in my generation , there will not be 50 percent of &#91; women &#93; at the top of any industry .
i mean , they compl@@ ain about it all the time .
so go br@@ ush and flo@@ ss your teeth .
and i don &apos;t know if it works .
we should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now .
there is no good faith in this .
they go right to doctors .
so that &apos;s our general blood work test .
why is wired magazine doing this ?
it works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today .
design -- i love its design .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
both of us were dis@@ sem@@ in@@ ating the genes of one species and not another ,
i had thought always -- and in fact , had written this in my first book ; this was a book about gar@@ den@@ ing -- that law@@ ns were nature under culture &apos;s bo@@ ot ,
but the weird thing is , we have not absor@@ bed this lesson 150 years later ;
and we came out with only 2@@ 3,000 .
it &apos;s a very el@@ abor@@ ate and beautiful dance , but i &apos;m going to just give you a clo@@ se-@@ up on one piece of it ,
and third , while they &apos;re in this pa@@ d@@ do@@ ck they are , of course , def@@ ec@@ ating ma@@ dly and their very ni@@ tro@@ gen@@ ous man@@ ure is ferti@@ li@@ zing this field .
more for us , less for nature .
why ? it became a question my entire life , and that &apos;s all right , because being good at math meant he bought me a computer , and some of you remember this computer , this was my first computer .
and then movies , via c@@ d-@@ ro@@ m . it was amazing .
it &apos;s just amazing , fear . but that &apos;s form , content .
it has 10 variations .
because at ris@@ d , you have to look at the actual animal , the object , to understand its volume , to perce@@ ive it .
my favorite ones are &quot; no plants . &quot; why would you bring a plant to a national mon@@ u@@ ment ? i &apos;m not sure . and also &quot; no love . &quot;
so what this is , is a kind of a sk@@ et@@ ch , an application sk@@ et@@ ch i wrote in py@@ th@@ on . you know how there &apos;s photo@@ shop ?
and before i get started today , since many of you are wondering , i just wanted to get it out of the way .
austr@@ alia , because there just aren &apos;t very many people there .
and so i guess the u.s. finally , finally started to like it , too .
but it was a dream of his , and we , basically , when people really want to do something , well , we generally let them .
and news , which i just mentioned , was started by a resear@@ cher . and he just -- he -- after 9 / 11 , he got really interested in the news .
all right , see ? you guys should try it out .
a lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other , and in@@ form@@ ally .
because you can type , you know , any kind of thing into google , and you expect an answer back , right ?
and we don &apos;t have this fe@@ ature anymore .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already under construction ; it &apos;s already happening .
if you &apos;re not , too bad . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
so i just recently dro@@ pped out of pr@@ inc@@ et@@ on and actually ended up for the first time in a bar , and i saw these happy hour things all over the place , right .
you should lose points for not doing this on time .
and it &apos;s very powerful .
these progr@@ ession dynam@@ ics are powerful and can be used in the real world .
we use game dynam@@ ics to build on it . we build with min@@ d@@ share .
am@@ using ? yes . des@@ ir@@ able ? maybe .
so somehow , we went from this to this .
instead of thinking about what to build , building in order to think .
so in one of their projects called sou@@ th@@ war@@ k circle , they worked with res@@ id@@ ents in sou@@ th@@ war@@ k , south london and a small team of designers to develop a new mem@@ ber@@ ship organization to help the el@@ der@@ ly with house@@ hold tas@@ ks .
what &apos;s the design bri@@ ef ?
so i &apos;d like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference , that it can help create new ideas and new innovations , beyond the lat@@ est high street products .
but from the japanese perspective , it &apos;s their du@@ ty to protect those who don &apos;t know any better -- in this case , the ignor@@ ant g@@ ai@@ j@@ in -- from making the wrong choice .
with this proce@@ dure , we were able to en@@ sure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity , making it easier for us to compare performance .
you will su@@ rely find the perfect match .
i don &apos;t mean to say that i want no choice , but many of these choices are quite artificial . &quot; in reality , many choices are between things that are not that much different .
if she survi@@ ved , she would rem@@ ain in a perman@@ ent veget@@ ative state , never able to walk , talk or interact with others .
it &apos;s a great story , and it &apos;s underst@@ and@@ able why they would be re@@ lu@@ c@@ tant to re@@ vis@@ e it .
yeah , i -- as you would expect -- get pretty frustr@@ ated by choices like what n@@ ail po@@ lish to put on because i have to rely on what other people suggest .
now , of the women that could tell them apart , when the lab@@ els were off , they picked &quot; ador@@ able , &quot; and when the lab@@ els were on , they picked &quot; ball@@ et sli@@ p@@ pers . &quot;
i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff .
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accoun@@ ting and arti@@ ll@@ ery mor@@ ph into media ?
journalis@@ t : thank you very much indeed , mr. for@@ rester and the mit lab .
to build that , what we &apos;d do with wh@@ ir@@ l@@ wind technology is we &apos;d have to take up roughly from the 10 to mul@@ hol@@ land , and from the 4@@ 0@@ 5 to la ci@@ en@@ eg@@ a just with those wh@@ ir@@ l@@ win@@ ds .
that &apos;s the way we get some of the magic into it , boys and girls .
mm : the global village is a world in which you don &apos;t necessarily have harmon@@ y . you have extreme concer@@ n with everybody else &apos;s business and much invol@@ vement in everybody else &apos;s life .
i think these ideas are difficult to understand , because when you &apos;re tr@@ apped in one paradig@@ m , the next paradig@@ m is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense .
by the way , speaking of the fil@@ ing system , it never occurred to us that these hyper@@ lin@@ ks could go beyond the local area network .
ted tur@@ ner : we did the work to build this , this cable industry , now the broad@@ ca@@ sters want some of our money . i mean , it &apos;s ridi@@ cul@@ ous .
and it &apos;s no wonder that as we head into the writ@@ ers &apos; stri@@ ke , od@@ d things happen .
and the head of marketing at ni@@ ke says , &quot; people are coming to our site an average of three times a week . we don &apos;t have to go to them . &quot; which means television advertis@@ ing is down 5@@ 7 percent for ni@@ ke .
ro@@ b for@@ bes on ways of seeing
all cities where there are a whole lot of bicy@@ cles , and where pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an areas -- and i came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that de@@ al@@ t with bicy@@ cles and foot traffic , and i &apos;m sure the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic eye would say , no , the cor@@ relation there is that there are univer@@ si@@ ties and schools where people can &apos;t afford cars , but it did seem that in many of these areas pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an traffic was protected .
just a wonderful kind of break@@ up of architecture , and the way that the trees form vertical elements .
and cu@@ ba needs to be far more res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful , because of the blo@@ ck@@ ades and things , but a really wonderful play@@ ground .
and i thought that if pattern can un@@ ite these dispar@@ ate elements , it can do just about anything .
my measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks , but the fact that it perfor@@ ms a very important social function .
and of course , in a way , when i say rom@@ ance , i mean in part the a@@ es@@ the@@ tics of that whole situation .
and when i was sitting in classes -- in which no one asked me to draw an airplane -- to my surprise .
all kinds of things .
so that if you sit down on my chair , whether you &apos;re five feet t@@ all or six foot six , it always de@@ als with your weight and trans@@ f@@ ers the amount of force requi@@ red to re@@ cl@@ ine in a way that you don &apos;t have to look for something to ad@@ just .
from the stand@@ point of how much of an aid they could be to your work life .
just reli@@ ev@@ ing your arms with arm@@ res@@ ts takes 20 percent of that load off .
while you &apos;re sitting in it you can ad@@ just it down for the fi@@ ve-@@ foot@@ er , or you can ad@@ just it for the si@@ x-@@ foot@@ -@@ six guy --
you might go to india , the far east .
interes@@ t@@ ingly , ma@@ de@@ ira first got the ins@@ ect in 2005 , and here we are , a few years later , first cases of den@@ gue .
it has to be safe .
now if that male is carrying a gene which causes the death of the off@@ spring , then the off@@ spring don &apos;t survive , and instead of having 500 mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os running around , you have none .
so we &apos;ve got that . you could call it a mos@@ qui@@ to factory .
my train was a heart attack .
and where do you ex@@ pose y@@ ourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot;
well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
we can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where paul has really spent a majority of his time .
that was what the conclusion of the dar@@ t@@ mouth at@@ las of health@@ care was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occu@@ r in disease , in ill@@ ness , in well@@ ness , and how our health@@ care system actually oper@@ ates .
--
this is ol@@ us@@ o@@ sun du@@ mp , the largest gar@@ b@@ age du@@ mp in l@@ agos , and 2,000 people work here , and i found this out from this fellow , andre@@ w s@@ abor@@ u .
so it &apos;s vast . but it should come with an ast@@ er@@ is@@ k , and the ast@@ er@@ is@@ k is that it exclu@@ des two thir@@ ds of the workers of the world .
they &apos;re going to ed@@ dy in l@@ agos .
so this goes on in the forma@@ l economy as well as the informa@@ l economy , so it &apos;s wrong of us to bl@@ ame — and i &apos;m not sing@@ ling out si@@ em@@ ens , i &apos;m saying everyone does it . okay ?
so , in all of these examples , structure is the deter@@ min@@ ing force .
calcul@@ us is also a mathematics of cur@@ ves . so , even a straight line , defined with calcul@@ us , is a curve .
so , it &apos;s tens of millions of calcul@@ ations just to design one connection between a piece of struc@@ tural steel and another piece of struc@@ tural steel .
i got interested in them because they &apos;re the most extreme example of a surface where the tex@@ ture and the -- let &apos;s call it the dec@@ or@@ ation -- i know the fro@@ g doesn &apos;t think of it as dec@@ or@@ ation , but that &apos;s how it works -- are all in@@ tric@@ ately connected to one another .
the steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of be@@ ams and colum@@ ns all rol@@ led together into a single system which is highly efficient , but also produ@@ ces dec@@ or@@ ative effects and forma@@ l effects that are very beautiful and organic .
but not always .
remember the second question that i raised at the out@@ set was , how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evol@@ ve to be mil@@ d ?
some countries that might have clean water sup@@ pli@@ es , so that you can &apos;t get water@@ bor@@ ne transmission : you expect the organism to evol@@ ve to mil@@ dness there .
they evolved to produce less tox@@ in . and to just give you a sense of how important this might be , if we look in 199@@ 5 , we find that there &apos;s only one case of chol@@ era , on average , re@@ ported from chi@@ le every two years .
whereas did ecu@@ ad@@ or actually have the beg@@ in@@ n@@ ings of the problem ?
so , if you were to mos@@ qui@@ to pro@@ of houses , you should be able to get these organisms to evol@@ ve to mil@@ dness .
but that &apos;s when you should be favor@@ ing evolution towards mil@@ dness .
and that will just add to the effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess of our control efforts .
and when they &apos;re missing , it &apos;s a barri@@ er .
there &apos;s no other fun@@ ctions .
now you think , &quot; close hand , &quot; and a little section of your ch@@ est contr@@ acts .
there is not a learning process .
so one of the best parts of my job is working with really great patients who are also our research collabor@@ ators .
and we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery , including over a do@@ zen of our w@@ ounded w@@ arri@@ ors in the u.s. arm@@ ed services .
she &apos;s carrying all the weight through har@@ n@@ esses .
t@@ k : that hand &apos;s not so good for cl@@ apping .
so rather than a super strong or super fast arm , we &apos;re making an arm that is -- we &apos;re starting with , the 2@@ 5@@ th per@@ centi@@ le female -- that will have a hand that wr@@ aps around , op@@ ens all the way , two degrees of freedom in the wr@@ ist and an el@@ bo@@ w .
yet what puzz@@ led me most was cel@@ ine had given her in@@ formed con@@ sent to be a part of this trial , yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a particip@@ ant or what would happen to her once the trial had been complet@@ ed .
con@@ sent proce@@ du@@ res that are used in ri@@ cher countries are often in@@ appropriate or in@@ effective in a lot of developing countries .
her story has a positive ending , but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortun@@ ate .
and one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the pro@@ per feedback .
and , more importantly , they &apos;re well-@@ dr@@ essed .
where it &apos;s blue and it &apos;s green , it means the water is really cold .
and it &apos;s dec@@ lin@@ ed fairly subst@@ anti@@ ally , about 21 percent since 198@@ 7 , when i started these surve@@ ys , in terms of number of active nes@@ ts .
in some years , like this year , we found more than 80 percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil .
the same thing &apos;s true for penguins as well .
and you &apos;ll see soon that my graduate student ... and you see , tur@@ bo &apos;s pretty int@@ ent on his fli@@ p@@ per pat@@ ting .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
let &apos;s start with the world of 19@@ 45 .
because the people in the east , who never wanted to be there anyway , have gotten on those tra@@ ins and roads and gone back to the west .
because glob@@ alization op@@ ens up all kinds of ways for us to under@@ mine and change the way we think about political ge@@ ograp@@ hy . so , the history of east asia in fact , people don &apos;t think about nations and bor@@ ders .
china ex@@ ports business people , nan@@ nies , students , teachers to teach chinese around the region , to inter@@ mar@@ ry and to occup@@ y ever greater comman@@ ding he@@ i@@ ghts of the econom@@ ies .
no . it &apos;s the pi@@ pel@@ ines .
he pur@@ pos@@ ely did not want these countries to make sense .
the more pi@@ pel@@ ines we have , the more silk roads we &apos;ll have , and the less of a domin@@ ant great game competition we &apos;ll have in the 21@@ st century .
now let &apos;s look at tur@@ key and the cau@@ ca@@ sus .
so den@@ mark is about to get a whole lot smaller .
and if they exist and you can find them , then maybe one could eventually do something about it .
and if you look at the tis@@ su@@ es of the animal , they &apos;re starting to det@@ eri@@ or@@ ate .
and the other part is on the inside where it s@@ ends signals into the cell .
and also , the common pre@@ cur@@ s@@ or also gave rise to people .
so fo@@ x@@ o turns on a lot of genes .
but it &apos;s det@@ eri@@ or@@ ating .
and mu@@ tations that damage the tor gene -- just like the d@@ af@@ -@@ 2 mu@@ tations -- ex@@ tend lif@@ esp@@ an in wor@@ ms and flies and mi@@ ce .
there &apos;s a phenomenon which you have written about and spo@@ ken about , which is a neg@@ li@@ gi@@ ble sen@@ escence .
m@@ r : thank you very much indeed , cy@@ n@@ th@@ ia ken@@ y@@ on .
who@@ ever has the most money gets the lou@@ dest voice , domin@@ ating the visual and mental environment .
because it s@@ ends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .
as long as we believe that people , our own neighbors , are sel@@ fish , stupid or la@@ z@@ y , then there &apos;s no hope .
but as there was still a dire shor@@ t@@ age of don@@ or organs , the gi@@ ft of life was then ext@@ ended from living , related don@@ ors to now living , un@@ related don@@ ors .
and this inspired in my mind a shift from trans@@ plan@@ ting whole organs to perhaps trans@@ plan@@ ting cells .
earlier that week , i had taken a rather hard kno@@ ck during late spring ski@@ ing -- yes , i fell .
and in the u.k. , neur@@ al stem cells to treat stro@@ ke are being investi@@ g@@ ated in a phase one trial .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
what are they doing right ?
one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a div@@ or@@ ce .
that &apos;s right -- when you have a close couple friend sp@@ lit up , it incre@@ ases your chances of getting a div@@ or@@ ce by 75 percent .
and for the good of your relationships , i would encourage you to do the same .
somewhere , in a pattern like this , is you , your per@@ cep@@ tions , your emotions , your mem@@ ories , your plans for the future .
such an approach would literally , in a fl@@ ash of light , over@@ come many of the obstacles to discovery .
it was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student , su@@ san@@ a li@@ ma .
the left and the right hal@@ ves of the cham@@ ber are filled with two different od@@ ors , and a security camera wat@@ ches as the flies pace up and down between them .
if you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right , you can see that whenever it re@@ aches the mid@@ point of the cham@@ ber where the two od@@ ors meet , it mar@@ ches straight through , as it did before .
i don &apos;t know about you , but i find it ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating to see how vague psycho@@ logical no@@ tions ev@@ a@@ por@@ ate and give rise to a physical , mechan@@ istic understanding of the mind , even if it &apos;s the mind of the fly .
and we wonder@@ ed how they use these bizarre to@@ es to climb up a wall so quickly .
and you can try this in the lo@@ bby , and look at the g@@ ec@@ k@@ o-@@ inspired material .
it can also act as a counter@@ balance .
if you make it sli@@ p a huge amount , this is what we discovered .
so all you need is a s@@ wing of the tail to right yourself .
it &apos;s un@@ believ@@ able .
&lt; transcript &gt;
there &apos;s not a lot of science behind that one either .
so here &apos;s the thing . it sounds like a simple question .
and we dr@@ illed in the ross sea .
this se@@ di@@ ment is 100 percent made up of the shel@@ ls of micro@@ scop@@ ic plants .
and so , when a coral colon@@ y is killed by an el n@@ in@@ o event , it leaves this ind@@ eli@@ ble record .
i &apos;ll take you back here to the gal@@ ap@@ agos islands .
it &apos;s not just my group ; there &apos;s maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this .
so i &apos;ll close with a short discussion of ocean aci@@ di@@ fication .
you have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when co2 levels were double what they are today .
and a long time ago -- well , about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student .
and i began to start teaching there .
how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding
it made me sick to my stom@@ ach .
and i saw this with audi@@ ences . this woman came up to me after the scre@@ ening and said , &quot; you know , i know this is crazy . i saw the bomb@@ s being lo@@ aded on the planes ; i saw the military going out to war .
and that you give israel an ali@@ bi to carry on ?
but after thinking log@@ ically about it , i didn &apos;t find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering .
i watched it and i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m blo@@ wn away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world , independent voices from around the world , and create a truly democratic , global television .
so what we &apos;d like to call this day of film is p@@ ang@@ e@@ a cin@@ em@@ a day .
even the earth war@@ ps space around it . now look at the moon . the moon is kept in or@@ bit , according to these ideas , because it rol@@ ls along a valley in the cur@@ ved environment that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtu@@ e of their presence . we go to a ful@@ l-@@ frame view of this . the earth itself is kept in or@@ bit because it rol@@ ls along a valley in the environment that &apos;s cur@@ ved because of the sun &apos;s presence . that is this new idea about how gravity actually works . now , this idea was tes@@ ted in 19@@ 19 through astronom@@ ical observ@@ ations . it really works . it descri@@ bes the data .
but if we zoom in and take the perspective of , say , a little ant walking around --
they have little elec@@ trons that s@@ warm around a central nucl@@ eus with neu@@ trons and prot@@ ons .
no , that &apos;s not one of the other predic@@ tions of string theory . but it rai@@ ses the question : are we just trying to hi@@ de away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?
when you s@@ wing your hand , you &apos;d be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it .
that &apos;s the kind of de@@ br@@ is we expect to be e@@ j@@ ected out , if the extra dimensions are real .
really ? okay .
and now you see it .
we &apos;re very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attribu@@ tes , like language .
your brain is learning . and it &apos;s learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumin@@ ation ; the left side of its visual field is under green illumin@@ ation .
so you see it that way .
your brain doesn &apos;t know . because both are equ@@ ally likely .
now remember -- -- she &apos;s supposed to be going to the blue f@@ lowers .
and now he &apos;s going to turn around , close his eyes , and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed .
now , some of you will notice that the conse@@ quence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right , or your left , is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right .
that might be true , but it &apos;s not terri@@ bly relevant .
most of the time , feeling and reality are the same .
when something is so common , it &apos;s no longer news -- car cr@@ ash@@ es , domes@@ tic violence -- those are the risks you worry about .
but if you know stuff , you &apos;re more likely to have your feelings match reality .
so this model is an intelligent represent@@ ation of reality .
so models can change .
and when the vaccine appeared last winter , there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who re@@ f@@ used to get it -- as a nice example of how people &apos;s feelings of security change , how their model changes , sort of wil@@ dly with no new information , with no new input .
new models that ex@@ tend long peri@@ ods of time are hard .
now , what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models -- have it refl@@ ected in their feelings -- to allow them to make security tra@@ de-@@ off@@ s .
those tam@@ per@@ -@@ pro@@ of cap@@ s , that came from this .
just think for a moment .
this is a nu@@ clear@@ -@@ pro@@ of facilit@@ y .
and this is a distribu@@ ted network .
some of these plants , like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen , they are down to the last few re@@ main@@ ing members .
some la@@ sted 14@@ -@@ and-@@ a-@@ half minutes .
and it was very funny . i used four , five and six years old kids .
we are eating more mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lows than we are producing .
they need political solutions .
we need military presence , but we need to move to politics .
the point is that we are probably seeing , for the first time in the history of the ar@@ ab world , a revolution bot@@ tom@@ -up -- people &apos;s revolution . social groups are taking to the streets .
and the parado@@ x is that the decade before the last decade was so promis@@ ing -- and for one reason prim@@ arily .
all of a sudden , n@@ gos were not only standing in the streets , cr@@ ying their s@@ log@@ ans , but they were taking &#91; them &#93; into the negoti@@ ations , part@@ ly because they represent@@ ed the vic@@ ti@@ ms of these weapons .
thank you for your attention .
so , some people are afraid of what i do .
the one on the page here is the same that &apos;s up there .
now , it &apos;s kind of nu@@ ts to work on a new nuclear re@@ actor .
various parts of the world will have a cul@@ t food that people get enorm@@ ously atta@@ ched to --
is that you ? &quot; i said , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s just a movie ! come on . &quot; so , the set@@ i institute , with a little bit of help from me , and a lot of help from paul all@@ en and a variety of other people , is building a de@@ dic@@ ated radio telescope in h@@ at cre@@ ek , california , so they can do this set@@ i work .
now , this is what ty@@ ran@@ no@@ sau@@ rus re@@ x looks like in my living room .
now , to a human audience , i need to explain that if pen@@ thou@@ se magazine had a marine mam@@ mal e@@ dition , this would be the cent@@ er@@ fold .
and the first story is called &quot; the fau@@ l@@ ty switch . &quot;
or the dis@@ tant pe@@ el of th@@ under ?
and then back again .
the rest of the collection re@@ mains here , sto@@ red in pl@@ ain brown paper bag@@ s until fun@@ ds can be raised to build a perman@@ ent museum and study center .
and there probably are special cases of that .
you predict a black hole , and you look out the telescope and there it is , just like you said .
it requires hundreds of steps , and it takes a long , long time .
and i &apos;ll show you what that protein measu@@ rement looks like .
and you can see , mostly it over@@ lap@@ s and it &apos;s yellow , but there &apos;s some things that just al@@ ice has and some things that just bob has .
it &apos;s you ; you &apos;re broken .
and i &apos;m not saying you shouldn &apos;t mo@@ p up your water if you have cancer ,
because your body will do most of the work of fix@@ ing it if we just sort of pro@@ p it up in the ways that are wrong .
but they also talked about which candi@@ date they were going to support .
you &apos;re all a member of tri@@ bes .
now , am i saying that in every department of motor vehic@@ les across the land , you find a stage two culture ?
i happened to be in the elev@@ ator collec@@ ting data for this book .
now , what &apos;s important to people at z@@ ap@@ pos , these may not be the things that are important to you .
saying , &quot; we &apos;re great &quot; -- that sounds pretty good .
and those are the ones that change the world .
see , people who build worl@@ d-@@ changing tri@@ bes do that .
and you don &apos;t leave them where they are . you nu@@ dge them forward .
and the going is pretty r@@ ough right now .
i &apos;m not sure if i can show you what tol@@ er@@ ance looks like , but i can show you what compassion looks like -- because it is visible .
he &apos;s says that what they do with l &apos;@@ ar@@ che is not a solution , but a sign .
he once said that science in his generation had become like a ra@@ z@@ or bl@@ ade in the hands of a three-@@ year-old .
einstein became a human@@ itarian , not because of his ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite knowledge of space and time and matter , but because he was a je@@ w as ger@@ many grew fas@@ cist .
but i rec@@ ited a che@@ er . i rec@@ ited a che@@ er along with everybody else .
now to see the bi@@ as clearly you need to understand what intro@@ version is .
and they all took the s@@ pot@@ light , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
see@@ kers who are going off by themselves alone to the wil@@ der@@ ness where they then have profound epi@@ phan@@ ies and re@@ vel@@ ations that they then bring back to the rest of the community .
so , quite underst@@ and@@ ably , quali@@ ties like mag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m and char@@ is@@ ma suddenly come to seem really important .
and people would come from all over to hear him speak .
but we need much more priv@@ acy and much more freedom and much more autonom@@ y at work .
but what i &apos;d like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often .
now , i don &apos;t know how many of you have ever done that with your kids , but if you do , please trust me , it &apos;s the most pressure you can put on a child , to say -- -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing .
the thing that becomes appar@@ ent is three pieces .
so , there has not been a human@@ -@@ cen@@ tric approach to ad@@ dr@@ essing this se@@ gment of the market , so we really believe it is critical to think of it .
children dress with very color@@ ful , color@@ ful clo@@ thes , and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids , in a computer . and i have to tell you that it &apos;s so easy to appreci@@ ate the impact that access to technology and connec@@ tivity can have in the lives and education of these kids .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s enough to be able to put them on a sp@@ read@@ she@@ et , and look at numbers and say , yes , that &apos;s a good business .
this thing &apos;s selling still about a million cop@@ ies a month .
there are sec@@ ular ko@@ o@@ ks ; there are smart ko@@ o@@ ks , du@@ m@@ b ko@@ o@@ ks .
that &apos;s kind of a no@@ -@@ br@@ ain@@ er .
this is why i believe what i believe . &quot;
it makes a difference what you believe .
it comes from ser@@ ving .
and , by the way , your net worth is not the same thing as your self-@@ worth .
ok . what &apos;s that all about ? well , i do know a couple of things .
what do you do with a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d &apos;s staff ?
that , to me , is what being pur@@ pos@@ e-@@ driven is all about .
thank you .
before , they were closed off .
and by being a zer@@ o-@@ dollar laptop , we can go to countries that can &apos;t afford it at all .
in fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
i &apos;ll give you an analo@@ g@@ y .
you &apos;re all c@@ f@@ o , as@@ troph@@ ysi@@ cis@@ ts , ul@@ tra@@ -@@ mar@@ ath@@ on@@ ers , it turns out .
the first thing we usually do when someone dis@@ agre@@ es with us is we just assu@@ me they &apos;re ignor@@ ant .
and so i &apos;m listening and i &apos;m listening , and at some point , i start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
so here we are again .
what happened in agriculture ? well , if you take agriculture over a century , agriculture in about 19@@ 00 would have been recogni@@ z@@ able to somebody plan@@ ting a thousand years earlier . yeah , the plo@@ ws look different . the machines were tr@@ actors or stuff instead of mu@@ les , but the far@@ mer would have understood : this is what the guy &apos;s doing , this is why he &apos;s doing it , this is where he &apos;s going . what really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this bru@@ te force engineering and chemistry into biology , and that &apos;s where you get your produc@@ tivity incre@@ ases . and as you do that stuff , here &apos;s what happens to produc@@ tivity .
this is called coal bed meth@@ ane . why is this picture interesting ? because if coal turns out to be concentr@@ ated plant life , the reason why you may get a differ@@ enti@@ al in gas out@@ put between one mine and another -- the reason why one mine may b@@ low up and another one may not b@@ low up -- may be because there &apos;s stuff eating that stuff and producing gas .
when the d@@ ot@@ com bu@@ bble bur@@ st , hot@@ eli@@ er chi@@ p con@@ ley went in search of a business model based on happiness . in an old friend@@ ship with an employ@@ ee and in the wisdom of a bu@@ ddhis@@ t king , he learned that success comes from what you count .
that very human lesson , more than 20 years ago , ser@@ ved me well during the last economic down@@ turn we had .
so i realized in that d@@ ot@@ com crash that my role in life was to channel ab@@ e mas@@ low .
i hate to argue with einstein , but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can &apos;t be coun@@ ted or valu@@ ed , aren &apos;t we going to spend our lives just mi@@ red in measur@@ ing the mun@@ d@@ ane ?
we create the conditions for happiness to occu@@ r .
good question . but back to b@@ hu@@ tan .
but all of those questions are tan@@ gi@@ ble .
it &apos;s the int@@ angi@@ ble difference she makes during that one hour of work .
okay , one , two , three . audience : can you read this ?
your brain cannot deal with the un@@ certa@@ int@@ y of that information , and it gets ill .
so they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
d@@ ave stru@@ d@@ w@@ ick : so what we &apos;re going to do — student : 5@@ c .
the first auth@@ or is black@@ aw@@ ton primary school , because if it were ever re@@ fer@@ enced , it would be &quot; black@@ aw@@ ton et al , &quot; and not one individual . so we sub@@ mit it to a public access journal , and it says this . it said many things , but it said this .
now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ?
&lt; / transcript &gt;
we actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous , pois@@ on@@ ous plastic in them .
and it &apos;s going to wind up in a developing country -- often china .
you see , if you understand the link between what we &apos;re doing to pois@@ on and pollu@@ te the planet and what we &apos;re doing to poor people , you arrive at a very trou@@ bling , but also very hel@@ p@@ ful , insi@@ ght : in order to tr@@ ash the planet , you have to tr@@ ash people .
well that insi@@ ght of biom@@ im@@ ic@@ ry , of our scientists finally realiz@@ ing that we have as much to learn from other species . i don &apos;t mean taking a mouse and sti@@ cking it with stuff .
how can this movement be so passionate about saying we don &apos;t have thro@@ w@@ away stuff , no thro@@ w@@ away dead materials , and yet accept thro@@ w@@ away lives and thro@@ w@@ away communities like &quot; cancer al@@ ley ? &quot;
for a kid at that age , this was like infin@@ ite speed , dis@@ appear@@ ing , and i was very inspired by that .
on this next slide , is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure , because whether i give you a perfect sky@@ car , the perfect vehicle for use , it &apos;s going to have very little value to you unless you &apos;ve got a system to use it in .
how would a trip in a sky@@ car work ?
a ver@@ ti@@ cal@@ -@@ ta@@ ke@@ off air@@ craft needs an artificial stabi@@ liz@@ ation system -- that &apos;s essential .
if one of those fai@@ ls , you still have a second chance .
thank you .
do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
and if you can bring another device close enough to the source , that will only work at exactly that frequ@@ ency , you can actually get them to do what &apos;s called str@@ ong@@ ly couple , and trans@@ fer mag@@ netic energy between them .
credit cards , robot vac@@ u@@ um clean@@ ers .
so , i wanted to show you something .
&lt; transcript &gt;
i think there &apos;s a better solution .
it &apos;s covered with a cro@@ ch@@ et@@ ed n@@ etting that is em@@ be@@ dded with mus@@ h@@ room spor@@ es .
as we move to search , we rely on the relev@@ ance ran@@ kin@@ gs , the web mat@@ ching , the inde@@ x cr@@ aw@@ ling . but we want to use our brain !
we think a lot of good can come from this technology .
so here what we &apos;re trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3@@ -@@ d model space .
this is the pu@@ don@@ g area .
actually the country with more tele@@ phones is the sovi@@ et union , and the data re@@ fer@@ red to 198@@ 9 .
if i were to ask you , &quot; which are the two asi@@ an countries ?
so the east asi@@ an model has this massive selection bi@@ as -- it is known as sel@@ ecting on a depend@@ ent vari@@ able , something we always tell our students to avoid .
so you have to always think carefully about these decisions .
stati@@ cally , china is a one-@@ party system , auth@@ or@@ itarian -- there &apos;s no question about it .
compar@@ ing with a super@@ star is the wrong ben@@ ch@@ mark .
because , before the spread of coffee and tea through british culture , what people dr@@ ank -- both el@@ ite and mass folks dr@@ ank -- day@@ -@@ in and day@@ -@@ out , from d@@ a@@ wn until d@@ us@@ k was al@@ co@@ ho@@ l .
all of these concepts , as kind of rh@@ et@@ or@@ ically flor@@ id as they are , share this basic assu@@ mption , which is that an idea is a single thing , it &apos;s something that happens often in a wonderful illumin@@ ating moment .
in the inside , it &apos;s all car parts .
and when we think about the classi@@ c image of the scientist in the lab , we have this image -- you know , they &apos;re pour@@ ing over the microscope , and they see something in the tissue sample .
now the challenge for all of us is : how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long hal@@ f-@@ life , right ?
so they made it really easy to find it .
could you work on that problem ? &quot; and that &apos;s how g@@ ps was born .
so , to make a long story short , they came to canada .
so i present@@ ed those results at the international science fair , which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life .
we &apos;re re@@ moving the cancer cells , but we &apos;re reve@@ aling the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .
so i guess you could say that i &apos;ll probably be doing this for the rest of my life .
but it seems like by investi@@ g@@ ating , by att@@ acking cancer , by se@@ arch@@ ing where cancer is not , there has got to be something -- there &apos;s got to be something -- that &apos;s making this tissue res@@ istant to tum@@ ors .
4@@ 0,000 children all over asia .
and what stru@@ ck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were .
this is on the way home .
and suddenly i was calling , saying &quot; i &apos;m in kore@@ a , and i &apos;ve met this extraordinary girl . &quot; and i said , &quot; the grandmother thinks she &apos;s sick , but i think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also . &quot; and i said , &quot; i &apos;ll pay for the ... &quot; i mean , i had this whole sort of picture .
and she said , &quot; he says he knows who you are , what do you want ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; well , he &apos;s saying , &apos; who the hell are you to walk into my house , some rich american with your cameras around your nec@@ k , acc@@ using me of en@@ sl@@ aving my ni@@ e@@ ce ?
he actually agre@@ ed to the adop@@ tion .
we went back to our hotel room , and gene was showing nat@@ ash@@ a also where at@@ l@@ anta was .
and you know what kids are like when they &apos;ve been as@@ le@@ ep for like an hour , it &apos;s like they took five val@@ i@@ u@@ ms -- you know , they &apos;re all over the place .
and there , in the building were photograph@@ ers waiting for people to jump .
and four months later , the adop@@ tion pap@@ ers came through .
and seemed to be very popular very , very quickly .
this is sy@@ d@@ ney , who &apos;s going to be three years old in a couple of days .
dna analysis , one of the h@@ all@@ mar@@ ks of the scientific revolution of the last 400 years that he started , was the way we found which set of b@@ ones actually bel@@ ong@@ ed to the person who read all those astronom@@ ical books which were filled with le@@ f@@ to@@ ver hair that was cop@@ ern@@ ic@@ us &apos; hair -- obviously not many other people bo@@ ther@@ ed to read these books later on .
it &apos;s actually min@@ i-@@ ec@@ li@@ p@@ ses that occu@@ r when a planet pas@@ ses in front of its star .
so now we have plu@@ to to join the numbers of small planets .
but the statisti@@ cal result is lou@@ d and clear .
and that &apos;s a very basic question , which we don &apos;t know the answer to , but which we can try -- and we are trying -- to answer in the lab .
and that dee@@ per , under@@ lying point is that science is in the process of re@@ defin@@ ing life as we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observ@@ able universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here to here .
h@@ ans ros@@ ling un@@ ve@@ ils new data visu@@ als that un@@ t@@ angle the complex risk fac@@ tors of one of the world &apos;s dea@@ d@@ li@@ est diseases : hiv . he ar@@ gues that prev@@ ent@@ ing trans@@ mis@@ sions -- not drug treat@@ ments -- is the key to ending the epidemic .
and almost the same happens here .
you &apos;ll find the highest hiv rate in the world in african countries , and yet you &apos;ll find sen@@ eg@@ al , down here -- the same rate as united states .
i &apos;ve sp@@ lit kenya in its pro@@ v@@ in@@ ces .
and what is con@@ curr@@ ency ?
and we also know that most of them were or are very poor -- did not live for very long .
about the same percentage of its population , and a really huge , nearly three-@@ quar@@ ters share of global economic out@@ put .
not a big diver@@ gence in terms of uni@@ form design for bor@@ der gu@@ ards ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly , but in almost every other respect , it &apos;s a huge diver@@ gence .
one , competition .
that &apos;s the land gr@@ ant on the bottom half of the slide .
any culture can get the work eth@@ ic if the institutions are there to create the incenti@@ ve to work .
the first is , can you del@@ e@@ te these app@@ s , and are we in the process of doing so in the western world ?
no , we may h@@ ang on , despite the huge bur@@ d@@ ens of deb@@ t that we &apos;ve accumul@@ ated , despite the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work eth@@ ic and other parts of our histor@@ ical mo@@ jo .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
it doesn &apos;t take long from working with sp@@ id@@ ers to start notic@@ ing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life .
there &apos;s also ac@@ in@@ i@@ form silk , which is used to w@@ ra@@ p pre@@ y .
this makes testing spi@@ der silk really , really easy to do in the labor@@ atory , because we &apos;re actually , you know , testing it in air that &apos;s exactly the environment that sp@@ id@@ ers are using their silk proteins .
in fact , the tou@@ gh@@ est drag@@ line in this surve@@ y is this one right here in this white region , a non orb@@ -@@ web@@ -@@ we@@ aving spi@@ der .
clay shir@@ ky on institutions v@@ s. collaboration
recently , fli@@ ck@@ r has added an ad@@ di@@ tional function called tag@@ ging .
you notice we haven &apos;t got everybody who has a photo .
the photos are spread out over a longer period of time .
20 percent of the mer@@ chan@@ dise accoun@@ ts for 80 percent of the reven@@ ue , 20 percent of the users use 80 percent of the resources -- this is the shape people are talking about when that happens .
most of the co@@ oper@@ ative systems we &apos;ve seen haven &apos;t been around long enough to have gotten to the accep@@ t@@ ance phase .
in the su@@ bur@@ ban@@ ized , du@@ al-@@ income united states , st@@ ay@@ -@@ at@@ -@@ home mom@@ s are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from ext@@ ended family and local , small@@ -@@ scale neighbor@@ ho@@ ods .
so as much as we want the shi@@ eld laws , the background -- the institution to which they were atta@@ ched -- is becoming in@@ co@@ her@@ ent .
50 years in which loo@@ sely coordin@@ ated groups are going to be given increasingly high lever@@ age , and the more those groups fore@@ go traditional institu@@ tional im@@ per@@ atives -- like dec@@ id@@ ing in adv@@ ance what &apos;s going to happen , or the profit mo@@ tive -- the more lever@@ age they &apos;ll get .
it &apos;s got ger@@ m . those are the good things , but those aren &apos;t the tas@@ ti@@ est parts of the whe@@ at .
and we &apos;re hoping that , sort of , the enz@@ yme piece of d@@ ough becomes the fuel pack for the le@@ av@@ ened piece of d@@ ough ,
and there &apos;s a short rest period . it can be for a few seconds .
and stage 11 , we call it co@@ ol@@ ing -- because we never really eat the bread right away .
but most of those see@@ ds get cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed and turned into fl@@ our .
enz@@ y@@ mes are breaking forth su@@ gars .
this is the product that everyone in the world e@@ ats , that is so difficult to give up .
thank you .
it &apos;s more interesting to me . it &apos;s less boring for me .
i get to write , sometimes for so@@ lo@@ ists and i get to work with one person , sometimes full orches@@ tr@@ as , and i work with a lot of people , and this is probably the capacity , the role cre@@ atively for which i &apos;m probably best known professi@@ on@@ ally .
so in these two capac@@ i@@ ties , i &apos;ve been sc@@ av@@ eng@@ er , in the sense of taking , like , the sub@@ way map , right , or th@@ i@@ ef maybe , and i &apos;ve also been designer , in the case of making the wr@@ is@@ tw@@ at@@ ches .
so that gives you a little taste of that piece .
so how do we actually ask them the question ?
and how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
we have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
and it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the re@@ ver@@ end thomas b@@ ay@@ es , who was a statisti@@ ci@@ an and mathematici@@ an in the 18@@ th century .
it looks as if the w@@ aving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
a@@ g : every scientist will recognize that expression of des@@ pair .
and i think just the opposite is true .
it &apos;s like being in love in paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three doub@@ le-@@ espr@@ ess@@ os .
so , he or she s@@ its down , anim@@ ates it , and tries to antici@@ p@@ ate what &apos;s going to happen , and then these particular anima@@ tions are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game .
you ho@@ ok these up -- in this case , to the virtual muscles of that two-@@ le@@ gg@@ ed creature here -- and hope that it does something interesting .
now , the interesting bit is , if i move the obstac@@ le a tiny bit to the right , which is what i &apos;m doing now , here , it will fall over it in a completely different way .
what you see is it takes steps back@@ wards , it tries to counter@@ -@@ balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it &apos;s going to land .
and that &apos;s our first product that we &apos;re going to release in a couple of weeks .
this is another behavior they re@@ ques@@ ted .
for the first time , you &apos;ll have actors that really feel very interactive , that have real bodies that really re@@ act .
he &apos;s actually a better d@@ ancer than i am , i have to say .
you can draw , as everyone should .
you know the h@@ ind@@ us are killing us musli@@ ms . be car@@ eful . &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; du@@ de , i &apos;m h@@ in@@ du . &quot; he &apos;s like , &quot; hu@@ h ! &quot; you know , my work is inspired by events such as this .
i &apos;ve called for tech support again .
ok , so why is the problem acceler@@ ating ? part of the problem is , iron@@ ically , because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use .
his computer had cr@@ ash@@ ed , and he told the technici@@ an he couldn &apos;t rest@@ art it no matter how many times he ty@@ ped 11 .
you &apos;ve obviously never opened all the to@@ ol@@ bars , but all you have to type in is this little , teen@@ y window down here .
there are 200 countries in the world . we like to think of the internet as a global village . i &apos;m sorry ; it &apos;s not one yet .
david po@@ gue : yes , i do .
people are illumin@@ ating , putting manu@@ als in the boxes .
this is a little company that &apos;s done very well with simpli@@ city and el@@ eg@@ ance .
so the point is , this a really interesting story .
but i also , in looking at more powerful technologies and nan@@ otechno@@ logy and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies , became very concerned about the potential for ab@@ use .
and so to lim@@ it the danger of these new things , we have to lim@@ it , ultimately , the ability of individuals to have access , essentially , to pand@@ em@@ ic power .
the first is this whole area of education , and it really rel@@ ates to what ni@@ chol@@ as was talking about with a $ 100 computer .
if we take carbon nan@@ ot@@ u@@ bes , you know , i@@ i@@ j@@ im@@ a discovered them in 199@@ 1 , they just have incredible properties .
the whole green dream -- because it can be prof@@ itable .
and the difference between a normal flu seas@@ on and a pand@@ em@@ ic is about a factor of 1,000 in dea@@ ths and certainly enormous economic impact .
so we can design the future if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen , and ste@@ er us to a lo@@ wer@@ -@@ risk place .
and , as an out@@ growth of all of this then , i wonder about whether we can , and whether we even should , think about transport@@ ing ear@@ th-@@ type life to other planets .
so , back to mars .
so this is a very b@@ old st@@ atement .
so , perspective is everything and , because of the history that i &apos;ve just bri@@ e@@ fly talked to you about , i have learned to think about earth as an extr@@ at@@ er@@ res@@ trial planet .
and yet , everything in this c@@ ave has adap@@ ted to it .
we know that on mars and the moon there are tons of these structures .
and so , that allows you the flexi@@ bility to go into very challeng@@ ing terrain and actually make your way where you want to go .
imagine dec@@ id@@ ing right now that you &apos;re going to do it .
you can del@@ ay the grati@@ fication that the social ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ g@@ ement brings ,
i think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world , must be the rar@@ est bottle of wine in the world .
these white pe@@ ar@@ les@@ cent fla@@ kes hit the no@@ od@@ les , this hau@@ n@@ ting , wonderful , nu@@ t@@ ty , mus@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ y smell w@@ af@@ ted up .
thank you .
there is now a toil@@ et that has an mp@@ 3 player in it .
and , you know , when we pulled up to a stop@@ light the people in the ad@@ jac@@ ent cars kind of gave us resp@@ ect@@ ful no@@ ds .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve got a ta@@ sting coming up where we &apos;re going to serve the &apos; 47 cheval blanc . &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
and specifically , it &apos;s in terms of the very intense emotional re@@ wards that playing games off@@ ers to people both individu@@ ally and collec@@ tively .
let &apos;s say , for the sa@@ ke of argument , my mission is to get 15 pi@@ es and i can get 15 pi@@ es by killing these cu@@ te , little mon@@ sters .
and each of these re@@ wards is carefully cali@@ br@@ ated to the it@@ em .
and everything comes towards that , and they watch it cre@@ e@@ ping up , and they own that as it goes along .
and two things really flow from this .
i mean , we &apos;re beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycl@@ ing and energy conservation .
and i got from global security policy to food because i realized when i &apos;m hun@@ gry , i &apos;m really p@@ iss@@ ed off ,
&quot; what are you doing for america &apos;s kids ? &quot;
so i went and stood on a big grain bin in the mid@@ west ,
and instead of taking these two things as bi@@ fur@@ cated problems that are very separate , it &apos;s really important to look at them as one system .
we all tend to think that these systems are quite different ,
i st@@ ayed thr@@ illed until i got home ,
i know it &apos;s sho@@ cking , right , that architecture would actually say that .
and that &apos;s a project that is just about to open next week , the new home for the d@@ all@@ as theater center , the de@@ e and charles w@@ y@@ ly the@@ at@@ re .
but there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was un@@ expected .
i &apos;ll go through the three basic configu@@ r@@ ations .
here you see the various acou@@ stic ba@@ ff@@ les as well as the flying mechan@@ is@@ ms and cat@@ wal@@ ks over the audit@@ ori@@ um .
the theater has been going through its kind of p@@ aces .
at the e@@ g conference in dec@@ ember 2007 , artist jon@@ athan h@@ arr@@ is discus@@ ses his lat@@ est projects , which invol@@ ve collec@@ ting stories : his own , str@@ ang@@ ers &apos; , and stories coll@@ ected from the internet , including his amazing &quot; we feel fine . &quot;
and that suddenly , people , en masse , were leaving s@@ cor@@ es and s@@ cor@@ es of digital foot@@ print@@ s online that told stories of their private lives .
this is showing the world &apos;s most common feelings over@@ all right now , domin@@ ated by better , then bad , then good , then gu@@ il@@ ty , and so on .
and that water that you see there is the open lead , and through that lead , bo@@ wh@@ ead wh@@ ales migr@@ ate north each spr@@ ing@@ time .
so , how to extr@@ act this order of narr@@ ative from this larger story ?
these wh@@ ales are about 40 feet long , and we@@ igh@@ ing over 40 tons . and they provide the food source for the community for much of the year .
he was playing cop@@ s and rob@@ bers with his friends , running around town , and they all had plastic to@@ y g@@ uns .
a 2@@ 4@@ -year-old road s@@ wee@@ per . i caught her on her lunch break .
and i said , &quot; you mean , like a c@@ ave ? &quot; and she said , &quot; yeah , like a c@@ ave . &quot;
jh : so if you caught that , she said she hop@@ ed to die when she was around 40 . that was enough life for her .
we &apos;ve got about a minute left .
the ri@@ g@@ ors of military medicine are not so dis@@ similar from the third world -- poor resources , a ri@@ gor@@ ous environment , a series of problems in ligh@@ t@@ weight , and things of this kind --
the brown color indi@@ c@@ ates the amount of glu@@ co@@ se in the ur@@ ine ,
and the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left .
that &apos;s on a piece of 8 by 12 paper .
he was telling the truth . because in a different culture , the dog is a sur@@ ro@@ gate for you , you know , &quot; today , &quot; &quot; this month , &quot; &quot; since the rain@@ y seas@@ on &quot; -- there are lots of opportunities for mis@@ understanding ,
so , my view of the health care wor@@ ker of the future is not a doctor , but is an 18@@ -year-old , otherwise un@@ employ@@ ed , who has two things : he has a back@@ pack full of these tests ,
and in this particular case we were just interested in the repli@@ ca@@ bility of that .
we were very proud of this , particularly the title , which was &quot; e@@ gg@@ be@@ ater as cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ge . &quot;
we all strugg@@ led for an entire day to think about simpli@@ city .
that we respon@@ ded in 2005 and 2006 with tro@@ op de@@ plo@@ y@@ ments , but we still didn &apos;t put enough tro@@ ops on the ground .
and we had progress in the free media . we had progress in elec@@ tions -- all of this with the so@@ -@@ called light foot@@ print .
no , there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years .
you ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ate your f@@ ears ,
bos@@ nia and ko@@ so@@ v@@ o were signal succ@@ esses , great succ@@ esses .
why mountain res@@ cue ?
and we are always being temp@@ ted up to our nec@@ k .
one exception is in mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts .
in dec@@ id@@ ing your vote for president today , was the race of the candi@@ date a factor ?
and you see the relationship there with the rac@@ i@@ all@@ y-@@ based vot@@ ing patterns .
affir@@ ma@@ tive action is not very popular fran@@ kly , with white vot@@ ers , period .
but fran@@ kly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from n@@ y@@ u , have them go study for a sem@@ es@@ ter at the university of ar@@ k@@ ans@@ as , and vice ver@@ sa . do it at the high school level .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
i never will forget it .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
we have life im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment without parole for kids in this country .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
it would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
and m@@ s. par@@ ks used to come back to mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , john@@ nie car@@ r who was the organiz@@ er of the mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t -- amazing african american woman -- and virgin@@ ia dur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , cli@@ ff@@ or@@ d dur@@ r , represent@@ ed dr. king .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a kill@@ er .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no condu@@ ct in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ condu@@ ct .
he kept p@@ ac@@ ing back and forth .
the great increase in mass incar@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categ@@ ories .
unfortunately , it happens all the time .
she says , &quot; i did . &quot;
one was scr@@ at@@ ching at the end of the stick , another child list@@ ened at the other end .
the i@@ patient is getting wonderful care all across america .
but to her , it mat@@ tered deeply .
now if that were true , it &apos;s a true con@@ dem@@ nation of our health care system , because they had been seen in other places .
and out of that sense of failure , i remember , i would always exam@@ ine the patient .
i will never ab@@ and@@ on you .
no , it -- well , it has kind of a ri@@ ght-@@ le@@ an@@ ing bi@@ as .
these -- they &apos;re just two different things .
this is a u@@ f@@ o shot from my house in al@@ ta@@ den@@ a , california , looking down over pas@@ ad@@ ena .

we needed something that was portable , something that could be st@@ eri@@ li@@ zed and re@@ used across multiple babies and something ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low-@@ cost , compared to the 20@@ ,000 dollars that an in@@ cu@@ bat@@ or in the u.s. costs .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
na@@ than was the number two person at the san francisco sp@@ ca .
now there is a bunch of reasons for that , and stories about it .
if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff .

hu@@ go ch@@ avez did not invent the dis@@ affected middle and lower class of ven@@ e@@ zu@@ ela . he mer@@ ely led them .
she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it .
but in case you do , here it is :
something that matters . start . do it . we need it .
♫ she was pres@@ er@@ ved by mo@@ des@@ ty of the religion ♫ ♫ she was ador@@ ned by the light of the qu@@ ran ♫ sh@@ er@@ e@@ en el fe@@ ki : 4@@ sh@@ ba@@ b has been du@@ b@@ bed islam@@ ic m@@ tv .
we &apos;re not talking here about a clas@@ h of civiliz@@ ations .
so i travel the globe , and what i &apos;m notic@@ ing is that everywhere where roman@@ tic@@ ism has ent@@ ered , there seems to be a crisis of desire .
in love , we want to have , we want to know the bel@@ o@@ ved .
and then , more importantly , in this description about the other or myself -- it &apos;s the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no nee@@ din@@ ess in desire .
we are the only ones who have an ero@@ tic life , which means that it &apos;s sexu@@ ality transform@@ ed by the human imagination .
if everybody was f@@ an@@ ta@@ si@@ zing on a bed of ro@@ ses , we wouldn &apos;t be having such interesting talks about this .
on the other hand if you can &apos;t go , you can &apos;t have pleasure , you can &apos;t cul@@ min@@ ate , you don &apos;t have an org@@ as@@ m , you don &apos;t get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own .
this is a song that was recor@@ ded there .
and the music there , i would say , the instruments , the in@@ tric@@ ate rhy@@ th@@ ms , the way it &apos;s played , the setting , the context , it &apos;s all perfect . it all works perfect .
people in the audience in these op@@ era houses , when they were built , they used to y@@ ell out to one another .
it looks like bob dy@@ lan , but it &apos;s ma@@ h@@ ler .
he &apos;s wh@@ is@@ per@@ ing into your ears .
but now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
yeah . i think it &apos;s evolutionary .
i know that we &apos;re near the end of this conference , and some of you may be wondering why they have a spea@@ ker from the field of religion .
and in the course of one generation , israel was completely changed .
i would like to see or@@ ac@@ le take up that , or some other technological geni@@ uses work on this .
and it &apos;ll be on these questions : where did i come from ? why am i here ? where am i going ?
why do we suff@@ er ? it &apos;s an ag@@ e-@@ old question that we haven &apos;t ans@@ wer@@ ed .
and yet , a few years earlier , death never cross@@ ed their mind .
he was ast@@ ounded at the phenomenon we &apos;ve been consider@@ ing : that people can achieve extraordinary he@@ i@@ ghts in science , the arts and human enter@@ prise , yet they also are full of anger , hypo@@ cris@@ y and have -- and self-@@ hat@@ re@@ ds .
i had to make that decision .
especially i will not die for you .
it pre@@ ps you . it aims you .
before form i was stor@@ m , blind , ign &apos;@@ ant -- still am .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
i wish to go with you .
in liber@@ ia , for example , the teen@@ age pregn@@ ancy rate is three to every 10 girls .
i wish that sexu@@ al ab@@ use and explo@@ itation in schools would stop . &quot; this is the dream of the african girl .
let &apos;s journey together . let &apos;s journey together .
but not only did they do that , they went to those who were running for se@@ ats to ask them , &quot; what is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win ? &quot; and one of the guys who already had a seat was very -- because liber@@ ia has one of the str@@ ong@@ est rap@@ e laws , and he was one of those really fighting in par@@ li@@ ament to over@@ turn that law because he called it bar@@ bar@@ ic .
but the trouble is so many people talk so much ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish about work@@ -@@ life balance .
drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
so i jo@@ ined a gy@@ m . &quot; now i don &apos;t mean to mo@@ ck , but being a fit 10@@ -@@ h@@ our@@ -@@ a-@@ day office rat isn &apos;t more bal@@ anced ; it &apos;s more fit .

there &apos;s enough pre@@ ce@@ dent out there to show that a sustainable , commun@@ it@@ y-@@ friend@@ ly development can still make a fortune .
help me demo@@ crati@@ ze sustain@@ ability by bringing everyone to the table and ins@@ is@@ ting that com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive planning can be ad@@ dr@@ essed everywhere .
the bu@@ b@@ bles are the countries .
and this was 2007 .
and look here -- compare to the phili@@ pp@@ ines of today .
that &apos;s the part where i sold the vol@@ v@@ o and bought the to@@ y@@ ota .
sing@@ apo@@ re is the best one .
this we can call dollar street .
that &apos;s when research fun@@ ctions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people .
it &apos;s this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us , arg@@ ent@@ ina and mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que together 50 years ago , and says that mo@@ z@@ ambi@@ que did worse .
economic growth to me , as a publi@@ c@@ -@@ health professor , is the most important thing for development because it explains 80 percent of survival .
and remember , please remember my main message , which is this : the seem@@ ingly impossible is possible .
that every car you see out there is sculp@@ ted by hand .
it &apos;s that same kind of commit@@ ment , that same kind of beauty .
to@@ o@@ th@@ br@@ ush , cool .
we start out with 10 cars ; we nar@@ row it down to five cars , down to three cars , down to two cars , down to one car , and i &apos;m in the middle of that killing , basically .
so my concept of what a design studio was probably -- i wasn &apos;t up to speed on where these guys were .
you can probably remember ti@@ bur@@ on , it used to look like this .
we put the car back at the center of our thoughts , and we put love , i think , truly back into the center of the process .
this information is also pretty st@@ ag@@ ger@@ ing .
and the reason is that cancer , like every cell in the body , places little molecular bo@@ ok@@ mar@@ ks , that re@@ mind the cell &quot; i &apos;m cancer ; i should keep growing . &quot;
could we take this preci@@ ous and rare can@@ cer@@ ous material from this ch@@ est tube and drive it across town and put it into mi@@ ce and try to do a clinical trial and stage it with a prototype drug ?
you might know that fat has memory .
now the business model invol@@ ves all of you .
as a cosmo@@ logist , i want to ask , why is the universe like this ?
we would like to know what .
one of the people who did understand that this was a problem was richard feynman .
for one thing , the universe will exp@@ and forever .
it &apos;s very , very un@@ likely .
that will happen much more frequ@@ ently than the random mo@@ tions of atoms making you an apple or@@ ch@@ ard and some sugar and an o@@ ven , and then making you an apple pie .
but even black holes don &apos;t last forever .
if that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bigger multi@@ verse .
but well , i &apos;m feeling good right now .
a defen@@ se against hun@@ ger , which we were experi@@ encing by that time .
we grew up inter@@ acting with the physical objects around us .
a message written on a sti@@ cky note to my mom on paper can come to an s@@ ms , or maybe a meeting re@@ min@@ der automati@@ cally syn@@ cs with my digital cal@@ end@@ ar --
so , in order to realize this dream , i actually thought of putting a big@@ -@@ size proj@@ ector on my head .
thank you .
all the web@@ ca@@ m cameras have a micro@@ phone inside the camera .
chris anderson : so , pr@@ an@@ a@@ v , first of all , you &apos;re a geni@@ us .
ca : based on the people we &apos;ve seen at ted , i would say you &apos;re truly one of the two or three best invent@@ ors in the world right now .
taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease .
in fact , it goes against natural survival .
it is wid@@ ely as@@ sum@@ ed that the ear@@ li@@ est human art@@ works are the stu@@ pend@@ ously sk@@ ill@@ ful c@@ ave paint@@ ings that we all know from l@@ as@@ caux and chau@@ v@@ et .
by the end of the hand axe epi@@ c , homo s@@ ap@@ iens -- as they were then called , finally -- were doub@@ t@@ less finding new ways to am@@ use and ama@@ ze each other by , who knows , telling jo@@ kes , story@@ telling , d@@ ancing , or h@@ air@@ sty@@ ling .
we decided to give it a try ,
so all this vast amount of information is then f@@ ed into the computer , and the computer can do two things .
so think of it as a monit@@ or for the blind .
dh : so since we started this project , we &apos;ve been getting hundreds of letters , em@@ ails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
and what i &apos;ve spent 15 years doing in this business -- and it &apos;s taken me almost 14 to figure it out -- is i think about the future of wars in the context of everything else .
let &apos;s talk about a bat@@ tle space . i don &apos;t know , t@@ ai@@ w@@ an strai@@ ts 20@@ 25 .
this is not about overwhel@@ ming force , but propor@@ tional force .
we have a brilliant secre@@ t@@ ary of war .
they can indi@@ ct your ass .
what do you get then ?
i &apos;m talking about regu@@ lar@@ izing it , making it transparent .
they spent the 199@@ 0s working the mess@@ y scene between glob@@ alized parts of the world
everybody &apos;s got an opinion .
just be grat@@ eful robert re@@ ed didn &apos;t sho@@ ve that bomb up his ass .
the rule is going to be this .
that &apos;s where the national gu@@ ard &apos;s going to be .
the mar@@ ines are like my west high@@ land terri@@ er .
see me now . don &apos;t talk about it later .
fre@@ em@@ an dy@@ son says : let &apos;s look for life in the ou@@ ter solar system
if you look at the solar system , as we know it today , it has a few planets close to the sun . that &apos;s where we live .
and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy , but it happened .
so , the last thing i want to talk about is how to det@@ ect it .
we &apos;re having great difficul@@ ties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck .
&lt; transcript &gt;
what i realized then is , they didn &apos;t really want to change the leg@@ acy stuff ; they didn &apos;t want to change the insi@@ des .
it allows the person to switch , and to mix these two color@@ ations .
the pack@@ aging , and the website , and you need to continue to really touch the user , in many ways .
and at the time , i wasn &apos;t really working on computers .
it &apos;s a little bit like designing a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant , and it has to be easily serv@@ ic@@ e@@ able : you have to know where it is and what it does .
i was in the third year of my sev@@ en-@@ year under@@ graduate degree .
thank you .
and for reasons equ@@ ally un@@ clear to me , seem to be in@@ ordin@@ ately proud of the three of us .
but bar@@ ely six months into my new job , i met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assu@@ mp@@ tions .
she is on the tal@@ i@@ ban &apos;s hit list .
one father , who had initi@@ ally bal@@ ked at his daughter coming out in such a cho@@ ir , now wr@@ ites son@@ gs for them .
but no , for the prot@@ est , they dr@@ essed all in white , no ma@@ k@@ eu@@ p .
women like sa@@ ken@@ a and lea@@ h and lay@@ ma have hum@@ bl@@ ed me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assu@@ mp@@ tions of any kind .
it is in these little stories , these individual stories , that i see a radical epi@@ c being written by women around the world .
and i thought , &quot; well , sir , i am not a strateg@@ ist , nor am i speci@@ alist . i am mer@@ ely a story@@ tel@@ ler . &quot;
and so the really cool bit is , the idea is that we want to have a universal set of in@@ ks that we put out with the print@@ er , and you down@@ load the blu@@ e@@ print , the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device .
there was no separ@@ ation of sex@@ es .
but still , if you &apos;re going to speak about a musli@@ m culture , this has a core , the div@@ ine message , which began the religion , but then many traditions , per@@ cep@@ tions , many practi@@ ces were added on top of it .
and it is no secret that many islam@@ ic movements in the middle east tend to be auth@@ or@@ itarian , and some of the so@@ -@@ called &quot; islam@@ ic reg@@ im@@ es &quot; such as sau@@ di ar@@ abi@@ a , iran and the worst case was the tal@@ i@@ ban in afghanistan -- they are pretty auth@@ or@@ itarian . no doub@@ t about that .
it &apos;s our faith , and we will be lo@@ y@@ al to it .
and even the very extreme forms of islam@@ ism led to terror@@ ism in the name of islam -- which is actually a practice that i think is against islam , but some , obviously , extrem@@ ists did not think that way .
in 19@@ 50 , tur@@ key had the first free and fair elec@@ tions , which ended the more auto@@ cratic sec@@ ular regi@@ me , which was the beginning of tur@@ key .
and i believe that the islam@@ ic modern@@ ism which began in the 19@@ th century , but which had a set@@ back in the 20th century because of the political trou@@ bles of the musli@@ m world , is having a re@@ birth .
the fire gave way , earth emerg@@ ed -- but this was an ali@@ en planet .

when birds can &apos;t fly , they become vulnerable .
life is a force in its own right . it is a new el@@ ement .
this quickly escal@@ ated into a fi@@ ve-@@ day war between russi@@ a and ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a , leaving ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a ever more divi@@ ded .
they exclu@@ de people that died as a conse@@ quence of civil war , from hun@@ ger or disease , for example . and they also do not proper@@ ly account for civi@@ li@@ an suffering more generally .
in all three cases , local leaders were willing and able to make peace , the international community stood ready to help them negoti@@ ate and impl@@ ement an agre@@ ement , and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agre@@ ed .
second , diplom@@ acy .
i met ben@@ ki three years ago in sa@@ o pau@@ lo when i &apos;d brought him and other leaders from indi@@ gen@@ ous peop@@ les to meet with me and leaders from around the world , because we wanted to learn from each other .
he &apos;s created a co@@ oper@@ ative to help people diver@@ si@@ fy their li@@ v@@ eli@@ ho@@ ods .
why change ?
literature makes one sensitive , sensitive to people , to their dreams and to their ideas . &quot;
he &apos;s been a soldi@@ er , a teacher , a politici@@ an , a vic@@ e-@@ may@@ or and a business man .
they &apos;ve gone away from what they did before , and they &apos;ve gone to something they didn &apos;t know .
the two brothers one day decided to go on a race , three times around the world .
india . ind@@ us .
and then he went to the top@@ -@@ most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called mer@@ u .
which is right ?
sounds very much like the journey through the wil@@ der@@ ness to the promis@@ ed land , with the comman@@ d@@ ments held by the leader .
i love my@@ tho@@ logy too much .
so , how do you constru@@ ct belief ?
because it leads you to the path of fundament@@ alism and violence .
but that was interesting in itself . this is companies like v@@ on@@ age .
and it &apos;s so interesting that i thought i would tell you about it .
as i walk out of the house from my wi@@ -@@ fi hot@@ spot into the cellu@@ lar network on a call with my wife --
right ? nobody knows you &apos;re in pakistan .
so you get all of these really cool fe@@ atures -- like you can say , i want these people to be able to call me only during these hours . and i want these people to hear this gre@@ eting , &quot; hi bo@@ ss , i &apos;m out making us both some money . leave a message . &quot;
yeah ! you &apos;re all trying to write this down .
dp : he &apos;s connec@@ ting me ! he doesn &apos;t even tell me the phone number .
they have 10,000 people who are being paid 20 cents per answer .
so now i &apos;m going to tell you how to get out of that .
i love my job .
dp : oh -- sorry i for@@ got .
i don &apos;t understand why we &apos;re not there yet .
ok , you ta@@ p , &quot; done &quot; and it will find out the song and play it for you .
just to round it up -- this is the new apple power music stand .
it &apos;s all the things a phone should be .
fortunately , her lu@@ mp pro@@ ved to be ben@@ ign .
and bre@@ ast@@ s that fall into these two categ@@ ories are considered dense .
if we think about dis@@ rup@@ tive technology , we see an almost u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive .
if you can find a tumor when it &apos;s less than a centi@@ meter , survival ex@@ ce@@ eds 90 percent , but dro@@ ps off rapidly as tumor size incre@@ ases .
but with m@@ bi , we use just light , pa@@ in-@@ free com@@ pression .
and we &apos;re now rou@@ tin@@ ely using one-@@ fif@@ th the radiation do@@ se that &apos;s used in any other type of gam@@ ma technology .
of course we should .
one morning , in the year 195@@ 7 , the neuro@@ surgeon wal@@ ter pen@@ field saw himself like this , a weird fre@@ ak with huge hands , huge mouth , and a tiny bottom .
this is white noise .
and d@@ .@@ b@@ . will probably roll toward you .
i just do that to make money .
thank you .
when i bring the 10 living and self-@@ moving ben@@ ches in the exhi@@ bi@@ tion room , john was just bes@@ ide me , and was like , &quot; h@@ mm . h@@ mm . &quot;

when you come to my website , i actually know what you &apos;re going to do already because i &apos;ve seen you visit millions of web@@ sites before .
u@@ h hu@@ h .
maybe we just follow our gu@@ t .
it &apos;s an objec@@ tive truth about the form of two , the abstr@@ act form .
how about this : what if in any situation you could just calcul@@ ate , look at the choices , measure out which one &apos;s better and know what to do ?
he has autonom@@ y .
happ@@ ily , we &apos;re not machines , and we can do it .
just a few days ago , right across the street from here , there was hundreds of people gather@@ ed together .
we figure out what will happen with this technology .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , some would say .
so what was it about cr@@ ack coca@@ ine ?
so he showed up at the university of chicago .
su@@ d@@ h@@ ir , on the other hand , got right back -- walked down to the hou@@ sing project .
now , su@@ d@@ h@@ ir got to know very well the guy who had the un@@ fortun@@ ate as@@ sign@@ ment of trying to take the i@@ ow@@ a franch@@ ise .
it &apos;s easy to see , by the patterns of consumption they have .
now to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during cr@@ ack -- and i &apos;m not really foc@@ using on the neg@@ atives , but really , there &apos;s another story to tell you there -- if you look at the death rates -- just of random , young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states -- the death rates during cr@@ ack were about one percent .
and really , they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be .
but here &apos;s what he says about why they don &apos;t do that .
from regular , relative sky@@ di@@ ving i went on to free@@ flying .
so with all this knowledge , i also wanted to get into stun@@ ts .
j@@ c : yet . but people are trying . are you among those -- you &apos;re not going to comm@@ it -- are you among those trying to do it ?
ol@@ a@@ fur eli@@ as@@ son : playing with space and light
and my idea was to make the space tan@@ gi@@ ble .
the &quot; green river , &quot; as a kind of activis@@ t idea , not a part of an exhi@@ bi@@ tion , it was really about showing people , in this city , as they walk by , that space has dimensions . a space has time .
i &apos;ve walked a lot in the mountains in ic@@ el@@ and .
and suddenly it makes a difference in terms of making space accessible .
and this book was one of the most famous books in america for about 35 years .
he became a j@@ es@@ u@@ it .

rather than revolution , we &apos;re much more interested in evolution ,
the first story starts last year when we went to shanghai to do the competition for the dan@@ ish national pav@@ ili@@ on for the world exp@@ o in 2010 .
unfortunately , mr. chen is now in prison for corruption .
this is how it looks today ; all traffic j@@ am .
so the real mer@@ m@@ aid , the real water , and the real bi@@ kes .
over the sort of landscape of tri@@ angu@@ lar bal@@ con@@ ies that our client called the le@@ on@@ ar@@ do di@@ ca@@ pri@@ o bal@@ con@@ y .
and all the rain@@ water that dro@@ ps on the mountain is actually accumul@@ ated .
and our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the to@@ po@@ graph@@ y of az@@ er@@ b@@ ai@@ j@@ an and re@@ interpr@@ et them into urban and architec@@ tural structures , in@@ habit@@ able of human life .
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out p@@ en and paper because i &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
because we can &apos;t solve problems .
there are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the pr@@ ices , nor the si@@ zes .
and what they basically did was come out with a prior@@ iti@@ zed list .
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
it might even cost up towards a percentage point of gdp every year for affected nations .
basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do x amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in pre@@ vention .
of course , that &apos;s main@@ ly because climate change has good pictures .
they had all the same material but they could go vast@@ ly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own li@@ sts .
they were still done when i was on s@@ ab@@ b@@ ati@@ cal with my company in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia .
a fellow ted spea@@ ker , jon@@ athan hai@@ d@@ t , came up with this beautiful little analo@@ g@@ y between the conscious and the un@@ conscious mind .
one of them is to think without pressure .
designer su@@ zan@@ ne lee shares her experiments in growing a k@@ om@@ bu@@ cha@@ -@@ based material that can be used like fabri@@ c or veget@@ able lea@@ ther to make clo@@ thing . the process is fascinating , the results are beautiful and the potential is simply stun@@ ning .
after about two to three weeks , we &apos;re looking at something which is about an in@@ ch in th@@ ic@@ kness .
possibly a good performance piece , but definitely not id@@ eal for everyday wear .
it &apos;s absor@@ bing my swe@@ at , and it &apos;s feeding on it .
i told them that i studied and worked hard . if you tell them more , they won &apos;t understand anyway . &quot;
for example , i recently wrote an article in the new yor@@ ker magazine , but i can &apos;t afford to buy an ad in it .
in 19@@ 4@@ 1 , the bur@@ n@@ ished pat@@ ina of an all@@ -@@ american bas@@ e@@ ball glo@@ ve inspired the foun@@ der of co@@ ach to create a new collection of hand@@ bag@@ s from the same lux@@ u@@ ri@@ ously soft glo@@ ve@@ d-@@ hand lea@@ ther .
but i &apos;m curious . if you had a minute , say , with apple &apos;s head of manufactu@@ ring , what would you say ?
i spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bomb@@ ers and with tal@@ i@@ ban re@@ cru@@ it@@ ers , trying to understand how the tal@@ i@@ ban were conver@@ ting these children into live am@@ m@@ uni@@ tion and why these children were activ@@ ely sig@@ ning up to their cause .
then they ship them off , hundreds of miles away to har@@ d-@@ line schools that run along the tal@@ i@@ ban ag@@ enda .
they &apos;re ready to go out and fight because they &apos;ve been told that this is effectively their only way to g@@ lor@@ i@@ fy islam .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
but in the mean@@ time i invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the satur@@ nine system , and visit the en@@ cel@@ ad@@ us inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary ge@@ y@@ ser park , just because we can .
a trans@@ cend@@ ent idea . it &apos;s a set of proto@@ col@@ s that has changed everything from sh@@ op@@ ping to d@@ ating to re@@ volu@@ tions . it was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally not something a squ@@ ir@@ rel could che@@ w on .
they stre@@ tch across the ocean . they &apos;re three or five
and he said there was coming soon , depend@@ ing on the weather , but he &apos;d let me know when , and so with about four days notice , he said to go to this beach south of lis@@ bon , and a little after 9 , this guy will walk out of the water .
lis@@ a har@@ oun@@ i : a primer on 3d print@@ ing
it &apos;s actually using a laser to fu@@ se the new layer of material to the old layer .
typically , because we can create products very rapidly , it &apos;s been used by product designers , or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or re@@ it@@ er@@ ate a design .
and we &apos;re starting to see it being used for final end products .
we &apos;re all familiar with the idea of custom@@ ization or person@@ alization .
you can see , this came out of the machine in one piece and the electron@@ ics were in@@ ser@@ ted later .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
but he told me that after 9 / 11 , he began to have second thoughts .
and so there &apos;s now a lot of different violent ji@@ ha@@ ds all over the world .
and then the tal@@ i@@ ban gave the keys of k@@ and@@ ah@@ ar to os@@ ama bin lad@@ en . he made it our problem .
and perhaps , a time will come when they get the ri@@ ght@@ ful credit for it .

my first dream was to be a doctor , and the second was to mar@@ ry a good man who would stay with me and my family ,
so she has to give 10 percent of the mor@@ t@@ g@@ age -- of the total value , or about 400 dollars in sav@@ ings .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
first , the cour@@ se@@ work at cal@@ tech .
so i tried to figure out what other way could we try and make co@@ st-@@ effective solar electricity .
so for direct light , it takes only one boun@@ ce , for off@@ -@@ axis light it might take two , and for extreme off@@ -@@ axis , it might take three .
those were major break@@ through@@ s .
but if your fuel source is free , then the only thing that matters is the up@@ -@@ front capital cost of the engine .
and then when the air comes back after it &apos;s been co@@ ol@@ ed it pic@@ ks up that heat again .
these pet@@ als cost about a dollar each -- they &apos;re ligh@@ t@@ weight , inj@@ ection mol@@ ded plastic , alu@@ min@@ ized .
this is how we en@@ vision it would be in a res@@ identi@@ al installation : you &apos;d probably have more than one unit on your roof .
and at less than a fi@@ ve-@@ year pay@@ back , all of a sudden this becomes very economic
i &apos;d like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the head@@ lines you see in the paper .
but still , we look at the pieces .
and each one of the 11 chap@@ ters of the i@@ p@@ c@@ c has six to ten sub@@ sec@@ tions .
so i decided that i would start to draw . how hard could that be ?
but the painting refl@@ ects -- i don &apos;t think differently for children than i do for adults .
so it st@@ ayed in , and it was , and , you know , it was a good thing .
and basically , i was so , you know , it was so am@@ using , because i said , &quot; well , how much space do i have ? &quot;
so , &quot; my beautiful mother &apos;s family fl@@ ed russi@@ a as well . too many po@@ gr@@ oms .
a quote by ber@@ tr@@ and rus@@ sell , &quot; all the labor of all the ages , all the dev@@ o@@ tion , all the inspiration , all the no@@ on@@ day bri@@ ght@@ ness of human geni@@ us are destin@@ ed to extinction .
and then my au@@ n@@ t fr@@ ances dies , and before she died , she tried to pay with sweet &apos;@@ n low pack@@ ets for her bag@@ el .
i thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with .
t@@ d : so , even though i &apos;m some@@ what happy about the wonderful develop@@ ments that are happening in the world , still , i feel a sense of im@@ pe@@ di@@ ment , when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a hear@@ t-@@ to-@@ heart , or a min@@ d-@@ to-@@ mind , level .
and i think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us , but that , if we pay attention , we can see that there are little sym@@ b@@ ols of happiness in every breath that we take .
put them all together , and put all this under kind of natural selection , under mu@@ tation , and re@@ war@@ ded things for how well they can move forward .
but after a very short while , you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over .
ey@@ th@@ or b@@ ender : we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new ex@@ o@@ skelet@@ on this year .
thank you .
it &apos;s one of the most le@@ thal things we &apos;ve seen in circulation in the world in any recent cent@@ u@@ ries .
and in experiment@@ al fe@@ e@@ dings to ro@@ dents and fer@@ re@@ ts , we found that the animals exhi@@ bit symp@@ tom@@ s never seen with flu : se@@ iz@@ u@@ res , central nervous system dis@@ or@@ ders , parti@@ al paraly@@ sis . this is not your normal gar@@ den@@ -@@ variety flu .
most of these people don &apos;t actually know what their job will be .
we have no uni@@ form polici@@ es regar@@ ding quar@@ ant@@ ine across the united states .
there is some indi@@ cation that it may buy you some time in the mid@@ st of an out@@ break .
the virus was 100 percent le@@ thal to pregn@@ ant women
do you want to view the pand@@ em@@ ic threat the way back in the 195@@ 0s people vie@@ wed the civil defen@@ se issue , and build your own little bomb shel@@ ter for pand@@ em@@ ic flu ?
to say ah@@ h , if this happens then we are going to have a pand@@ em@@ ic ?
i mean 100 percent death rate is pretty sev@@ ere .
so we &apos;re going to have to go all@@ -@@ out ther@@ mon@@ u@@ clear response , stimul@@ ate the total cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine casca@@ de .
it &apos;s incredible just how light this thing is .
okay , i che@@ ated , it was a m@@ ere 20 seconds .
but in america you have to explain . what are clu@@ bs ?
and i put the ro@@ pe around and around and around and around and around ti@@ ll i had no more ro@@ pe .
manhattan no longer sp@@ re@@ ads its infin@@ ity .
so you don &apos;t want me to street ju@@ gg@@ le here , right ?
so i start the walk . everything is fine .
for a moment , the entire crowd had for@@ gotten their differences .
and dr. ter@@ ry er@@ win , in 198@@ 3 , called the canop@@ y , &quot; the last bio@@ tic fronti@@ er . &quot;
and so those epi@@ ph@@ y@@ tes are actually paying the land@@ lor@@ d a bit of rent in exchange for being sup@@ ported high above the forest floor .
i know that as a scientist , i have information and as a human being , i can communicate with anybody , inside or outside of academ@@ ia .
this experience of working with du@@ ke also led me to initi@@ ate a program called sound science .
our lat@@ est end@@ e@@ av@@ or , with a gr@@ ant from the department of correc@@ tions at washington state , they &apos;ve asked us to exp@@ and this program to three more pris@@ ons .
i had just re@@ turned from one of the dee@@ p@@ est di@@ ves i &apos;d ever made at that time , -- a little over 200 feet --
s@@ cu@@ ba di@@ vers can &apos;t get there , sub@@ mar@@ ines go right on past it .
it happens because there &apos;s too much concentration of oxygen in your body .
in 199@@ 4 , i was fortun@@ ate enough to get access to these prototype clo@@ se@@ d-@@ circuit re@@ brea@@ thers .
but , if we only had an oxygen gas supply cy@@ lin@@ der we wouldn &apos;t be able to go very deep , because we &apos;d run into oxygen tox@@ ic@@ ity very , very quickly .
now , as i showed you in the earlier diag@@ ram , these re@@ efs that we di@@ ve on start out near the surface and they go almost ver@@ tically , completely straight down .
video : look at those ...
and this is my favorite line from the article .
well , it turns out this little white fish buil@@ ds these giant moun@@ ds , one pe@@ bble at a time .
the survival of the species and survival of ourselves , because they &apos;re both about per@@ pet@@ u@@ ating the genome .
but here &apos;s what really per@@ pl@@ ex@@ ed me .
within a period of 60 days , his vo@@ ca@@ bu@@ lar@@ y went from two to three words to 300 words .
a film also exists in time ; it &apos;s an experience that you should go through emo@@ tion@@ ally .
think about that when you see that building , that sometimes the things we stri@@ ve for so hard in life we never get to see finished .
n@@ k : do you know anything about the architect ?
in social aspect of his life he was just like a child , he was not at all m@@ atu@@ red .
for many mill@@ en@@ nia , humans have been on a journey to find answers , answers to questions about natur@@ alism and trans@@ cend@@ ence , about who we are and why we are , and of course , who else might be out there .
remember , one billion ?
so , ultimately what &apos;s going to deter@@ mine the success or failure of set@@ i is the long@@ ev@@ ity of technologies , and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmo@@ s -- distance over space and distance over time .
occa@@ sion@@ ally , throughout history , this concept of this very large cos@@ mic perspective comes to the surface , and as a result we see transforma@@ tive and profound disco@@ ver@@ ies .
so , what would change everything ?
so , in the opening days of 2009 , a visi@@ onary president stood on the steps of the u.s. capit@@ ol and said , &quot; we cannot help but believe that the old hat@@ re@@ ds shall some@@ day pass , that the lines of tri@@ be shall soon dis@@ solve , that , as the world gro@@ ws smaller , our common humanity shall re@@ v@@ eal itself . &quot; so , i look forward to working with the ted community to hear about your ideas about how to ful@@ fill this wish , and in collabor@@ ating with you , h@@ ast@@ en the day that that visi@@ onary st@@ atement can become a reality .
indeed , the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumul@@ ates here 10 times faster than anywhere else in ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca .
why do we need to study this anymore ?
thank you . &lt; / transcript &gt;
maybe a decade , according to my friends in de@@ tro@@ it .
and protect another million jobs now at risk , main@@ ly in auto-@@ making .
because we all know the most about those ; probably everybody here dri@@ ves one .
and the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nic@@ ely .
and that doesn &apos;t even count , for example , that available land in the d@@ ak@@ ot@@ as can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every high@@ way vehicle in the country .
the same for g@@ ps .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the united states , after two years , we pulled together some surve@@ y data from another 10,000 children , dre@@ w up a set up of what we thought were the key fin@@ dings of our research , and spent another year transform@@ ing them into design heu@@ ris@@ tics , for designing compu@@ ter@@ -@@ based products -- and , in fact , any kind of products -- for little girls , ages eight to 12 .
girl 1 : yeah , my character is usually a tom@@ boy . h@@ ers is more into boys .
mi@@ ko : i don &apos;t think so .
&quot; rock@@ et@@ t 28 ! &quot; rock@@ et@@ t : it &apos;s like i &apos;m just wa@@ king up , you know ?
now nobody believed him .
i &apos;m a psycho@@ logists -- why do orig@@ ins matter so much ?
they believe mc@@ don@@ ald &apos;s food is tas@@ tier , and it leads them to experience it as tas@@ tier .
so cap@@ gras syndrome is a dis@@ order where you get a specific del@@ usion .
with my colleagues george new@@ man and g@@ il di@@ es@@ end@@ ru@@ ck , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of fac@@ tors , what sort of history , matters for the objects that people like .
this is a work by jack@@ son pol@@ lock .
so she &apos;s stun@@ ned that he &apos;s standing in a sub@@ way station .
the most extreme example of this is that in some cases , pain under the right circum@@ st@@ ances can transform into pleasure .
that &apos;s what happens in academ@@ ic journ@@ als .
so , &quot; red wine can help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
it &apos;s very strai@@ ght@@ forward -- you take a bunch of people , you sp@@ lit them in half , you treat one group one way , you treat the other group the other way , and a little while later , you follow them up and see what happened to each of them .
and this has been demonstr@@ ated in a whole r@@ aft of fascinating studies compar@@ ing one kind of plac@@ e@@ bo against another .
10 years ago , history repe@@ ated itself , interes@@ t@@ ingly , when ris@@ per@@ id@@ one , which was the first of the new@@ -@@ generation anti@@ p@@ sc@@ y@@ ho@@ tic drugs , came off copyright , so anybody could make cop@@ ies .
what you can see is , over on this side , the s@@ pu@@ ri@@ ous fal@@ se neg@@ atives , and over on this side , the s@@ pu@@ ri@@ ous fal@@ se posi@@ tives .
this is a problem that is currently l@@ acking a solution .
it all begins with em@@ pathy .
and before we know it , they send in the tan@@ ks and then send in the tro@@ ops , and lots of people are dying , and it &apos;s a very , very difficult situation .
let me help you with some things that you might be thinking .
and you feel something about this .
but there &apos;s something else .
i mean this is serious . you &apos;re afraid .
you &apos;ve got to see this -- bible bo@@ ot camp .
you &apos;re gener@@ aliz@@ ing . it &apos;s wrong .
so it &apos;s all about coal , and the chinese are here in the united states .
are they bru@@ tal kill@@ ers or patri@@ o@@ tic def@@ end@@ ers ?
and suddenly , without realiz@@ ing it , you &apos;re seeing the world differently .
you know in 19@@ 50 the typical ship car@@ ried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods .
and i think , as you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s reasons for optimis@@ m ,
to put this differently : larger markets save lives .
now , today , less than one-@@ tent@@ h of one percent of the world &apos;s population are scientists and engineers .
that is something that we should embr@@ ace -- a weal@@ thy china , a weal@@ thy india , a weal@@ thy africa .
here is gdp per capit@@ a from 19@@ 00 to 19@@ 29 .
so long as we he@@ w to these two ideas : to keep glob@@ aliz@@ ing world markets , keep ext@@ ending co@@ operation across national boun@@ dar@@ ies , and keep inves@@ ting in education .
my choice is the cul@@ min@@ ation of a lifetime commit@@ ment that began with growing up on the gulf coast of al@@ ab@@ ama , on the flor@@ id@@ a pen@@ in@@ su@@ la .
consider the n@@ em@@ ato@@ de r@@ oun@@ d@@ wor@@ m , the most ab@@ un@@ dant of all animals .
as we move past the relatively gig@@ an@@ tic mam@@ m@@ als , birds , fro@@ gs and plants to the more el@@ u@@ sive insects and other small in@@ ver@@ te@@ br@@ ates and then beyond to the coun@@ t@@ less millions of organisms in the invisible living world envelop@@ ed and living within humanity ?
the hi@@ pp@@ o ju@@ gg@@ ern@@ aut we have created , if un@@ ab@@ ated , is destin@@ ed -- according to the best estimat@@ es of on@@ going bio@@ diversity research -- to reduce half of earth &apos;s still survi@@ ving animal and plant species to extinction or critical end@@ anger@@ ment by the end of the century .
am@@ ateurs can do it also .
and it &apos;s not just our quality of life which suff@@ ers .
now , that &apos;s a little un@@ fair . some of my best friends are architects . and they definitely do have ears .
add those up . that is a lot of children who are not rece@@ iv@@ ing their education proper@@ ly .
where are the office sound plann@@ ers ?
i was commis@@ sion@@ ed in 2003 to create an original show , and began developing &quot; up@@ wake . &quot; &quot; up@@ wake &quot; tells the story of zero , a modern@@ -@@ day business man , going to work with his life in a su@@ it@@ case , stuck between dream and reality and not able to dec@@ i@@ ph@@ er the two .
three hundred and for@@ ty@@ -@@ four fram@@ es , four and a half years and commis@@ sions later , what started as a one person show became a collabor@@ ative work of n@@ in@@ et@@ e@@ en most tal@@ ent@@ ed artists .
i know theater un@@ ites us .
we teach , touch and move .
and it cons@@ ists of seven chap@@ ters --
but i didn &apos;t want you to miss out on this one , because this , well , it &apos;s called &quot; por@@ ti@@ on-@@ controlled meat cu@@ ts . &quot;
the low-@@ tech bit is that it &apos;s literally a pi@@ g &apos;s heart val@@ ve moun@@ ted in the high-@@ tech bit , which is a memory metal ca@@ sing .
the world wide web , the french are told , ought to be re@@ fer@@ red to as &quot; la toile d &apos;@@ ar@@ aig@@ ne@@ e mondiale &quot; -- the global spi@@ der web -- re@@ comm@@ end@@ ations that the french g@@ ai@@ ly igno@@ re .
a hand@@ y thing to have , because language is infin@@ ite , and you can &apos;t just par@@ ro@@ t back the sent@@ ences that you &apos;ve heard .
you may just be lou@@ d or ob@@ no@@ xi@@ ous , or some other way caus@@ ing them to have the head@@ a@@ che .
second conclusion is that the ability to conce@@ ive of a given event in two different ways , such as &quot; cause something to go to someone &quot; and &quot; caus@@ ing someone to have something , &quot; i think is a fundamental fe@@ ature of human thought , and it &apos;s the basis for much human argu@@ mentation , in which people don &apos;t diff@@ er so much on the facts as on how they ought to be constru@@ ed .
or if a dinner gu@@ est after the m@@ eal pulled out his wall@@ et and off@@ ered to pay you for the m@@ eal , that would be rather aw@@ k@@ ward as well .
on the other hand , with indi@@ rec@@ t language , if you issue a ve@@ il@@ ed bri@@ be , then the dis@@ honest off@@ ic@@ er could interpr@@ et it as a bri@@ be , in which case you get the pay@@ off of going free . the honest off@@ ic@@ er can &apos;t hold you to it as being a bri@@ be , and therefore , you get the nu@@ is@@ ance of the traffic tick@@ et .
but what i &apos;d like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design .
and i said , well , in the same way that they exu@@ de a protein and it starts the cr@@ y@@ st@@ alli@@ z@@ ation -- and then they all sort of le@@ an@@ ed in -- they let go of a protein that stop@@ s the cr@@ y@@ st@@ alli@@ z@@ ation .
and there &apos;s a lot of cool technologies out there that life has .
back to that sh@@ ell : the sh@@ ell is a self-@@ assembl@@ ing material .
we see it that way . plants are bu@@ sy making long cha@@ ins of star@@ ches and glu@@ co@@ se , right , out of co2 . he &apos;s found a way -- he &apos;s found a cat@@ aly@@ st -- and he &apos;s found a way to take co2 and make it into poly@@ car@@ bon@@ ates . bio@@ de@@ grad@@ able plas@@ tics out of co2 -- how plan@@ t-@@ like .
what if we were to separate out met@@ als from waste stre@@ ams , small amounts of met@@ als in water ? that &apos;s what microbes do ; they ch@@ el@@ ate met@@ als out of water .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , there are millions and millions of geni@@ uses willing to gi@@ ft us with their best ideas .
this is the simple design bri@@ ef . i mean , it looks simple because the system , over 3@@ .@@ 8 billion years , has worked this out .
and if you &apos;re talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post-@@ conflict set@@ tin@@ gs , then you must talk about women , because they are the population you have left .
and when this story pos@@ ted , i ran to my computer to send it to the im@@ f offici@@ al .
she had come see@@ king serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to ex@@ port her chocol@@ ates to africa , europe , the middle east and far beyond -- capital that would help her to emplo@@ y more than the 20 people that she already has working for her , and capital that would fuel her own country &apos;s economic climb .
and when we talk about women , they are either excep@@ tions to be dis@@ miss@@ ed or ab@@ er@@ r@@ ations to be igno@@ red .
i would love to share with you a story .
they realized that , in 6@@ ,000 years of story@@ telling , they &apos;ve gone from de@@ pic@@ ting hun@@ ting on c@@ ave walls to de@@ pic@@ ting shak@@ esp@@ ea@@ re on facebook walls .
but what about a recycl@@ ed paper to@@ w@@ el that comes in those little half she@@ ets ?
and so this is fram@@ ing -- lu@@ m@@ ber , compos@@ ite materials --
on the scale of my por@@ tion of the house , this is equivalent to about as much as i drive in a year , it &apos;s about five times as much as if i went entirely veget@@ arian .
and in return , we just tried to kill them all the time .
but she did it all on her own .
wait for the light to stop the traffic .
and cro@@ ws eventually come by , and eat the pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts
they figure it &apos;s got@@ ta have more to it .
you know , he was &quot; born in 19@@ 12 , the year the ti@@ tan@@ ic san@@ k , greatest ship every built . hits the ti@@ p of an ic@@ e@@ berg , and b@@ am , it went down . it went down and i came up . wow , some century . &quot;
i say , &apos; thank god for a human reaction , we haven &apos;t lost yet . &apos;
so , talk about risk taking . i &apos;m going to do somebody that nobody li@@ kes .
i &apos;m just talking about the particular night that she died .
&quot; and then we got the baby and my other child , and we dro@@ ve out to , like , i-@@ 95 .
but at the end of &apos; 9@@ 2 , when we were in such tur@@ mo@@ il , and having all the financial problems , and all the mental problems , i began to really realize that kore@@ ans are completely left out of this society and we are nothing .
ign@@ iting , ign@@ iting , ign@@ iting fire . ign@@ iting fire .
you know , if i wasn &apos;t talking -- you know , like , you know , she wanted me to talk , i don &apos;t think she would even come out here . &apos;
&lt; / transcript &gt;
i &apos;ll get an es@@ l class in chin@@ at@@ own learning &quot; it &apos;s rain@@ ing , it &apos;s pour@@ ing . &quot;
everybody gets heard .
now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain dem@@ ographic categ@@ ory then you are predic@@ table in certain ways --
but they &apos;re having a hard time doing it because they &apos;re still trying to use dem@@ ograp@@ h@@ ics in order to understand them , because that &apos;s how ad rates are still deter@@ min@@ ed .
and i think that women are also going to continue to domin@@ ate the social media sphere .
bear in mind this was an ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound ,
and i said , &quot; so , could you do it right here ? &quot;
but it would be an org@@ as@@ m --
if you go all the way back to hip@@ po@@ cr@@ ates , physici@@ ans believed that org@@ as@@ m in women was not just hel@@ p@@ ful for conception , but necessary .
there &apos;s another way that org@@ as@@ m might boo@@ st ferti@@ lit@@ y .
and the happy result .
from ar@@ ous@@ al , all the way through org@@ as@@ m , in men and women --
which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of al@@ f@@ red kin@@ sey .
but after having lost a bel@@ o@@ ved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide , and sitting last year at ted@@ active , i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my tab@@ o@@ os to talk about an idea worth sp@@ reading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help .
as it turns out , there &apos;s a strong form and a wea@@ k form of this k@@ not , and we were taught to tie the wea@@ k form . and here &apos;s how to tell .
the materials that allowed the batter@@ y-@@ oper@@ ated fac@@ ial expressions is a material that we call fru@@ b@@ ber , and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen .
so , we &apos;ve made 20 robots in the last eight years , during the course of getting my ph@@ .@@ d .
what you &apos;re doing , right now , at this very moment , is killing you .
you &apos;ll be surprised at how fresh air dri@@ ves fresh thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas .
while i was pon@@ der@@ ing this question , i came across this urban le@@ gen@@ d about ern@@ est h@@ em@@ ing@@ way , who alle@@ ge@@ dly said that these six words here : &quot; for sale : baby shoes , never wor@@ n , &quot; were the best nov@@ el he had ever written .
i guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks .
or the reci@@ pe for the ultimate j@@ aw@@ -@@ dro@@ pping ted@@ talk : &quot; fli@@ ck@@ r photos of inter@@ gal@@ ac@@ tic classi@@ cal compos@@ er . &quot;
and yet , spec@@ ul@@ ative though the idea su@@ rely is , i aim to convince you that there &apos;s reason for taking it seriously , as it just might be right .
because the re@@ pul@@ sive gravity of an invisible energy in space -- we now call it dark energy , but i &apos;ve made it smo@@ key white here so you can see it -- its re@@ pul@@ sive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other , driving expansion to speed up , not slow down .
and you can think about those as he@@ ight , wid@@ th and dep@@ th .
it &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measu@@ red instead of any of the other possibilities and that &apos;s a question on which we can make head@@ way .
because such a mechan@@ ism has been found by cosmo@@ logists trying to understand the big bang .
the light those galaxies em@@ it , even traveling at the fa@@ st@@ est speed , the speed of light , will not be able to over@@ come the ever@@ -@@ wid@@ ening gulf between us .
so on the one hand , it &apos;s just incredible where we &apos;ve gotten , but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future .
he was quite a know@@ -@@ it-@@ all , and he wanted to kind of make you l@@ augh .
he &apos;s now going to use the other thing which is essential , and that &apos;s his voice .
we &apos;re actually teaching him .
mil@@ o &apos;s mom : oh , you &apos;ve got grav@@ y all over the floor .
and i promise you , if you &apos;re sitting in front of this screen , that is a truly wonderful moment .
i &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ ition , be perfect .
i gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
the three words are : do you remember ? &quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot; the other nur@@ se asked mat@@ ter@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ fac@@ tly .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and i went through the same period of shame and re@@ crimin@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
and it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ o@@ logical reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
your life as you know it goes into susp@@ ended animation .
it was a very som@@ ber gather@@ ing of the re@@ port@@ ers that worked there during the war , human@@ itarian aid workers , and of course the br@@ ave and cour@@ age@@ ous people of sar@@ a@@ j@@ ev@@ o themselves .
when i go back to sy@@ ri@@ a , next week in fact , what i see is incredibly hero@@ ic people , some of them fighting for democracy , for things we take for gran@@ ted every single day .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and you have a s@@ chem@@ e here that descri@@ bes how it works .
she can scr@@ at@@ ch her back , she can scr@@ at@@ ch one of us , she can play another game .
and by the way , they don &apos;t read english anyway , so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shif@@ ting position .
although their brains continue to produce those stor@@ ms and code for movements , they cannot cross a barri@@ er that was created by a les@@ ion on the sp@@ in@@ al cord .
and this leads to the wonderful iron@@ y that our languages exist to prevent us from communic@@ ating .
sure enough , their tools were more complicated than those of homo er@@ ectu@@ s , but they too showed very little change over the 3@@ 00,000 years or so that those species , the ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , lived in eu@@ ra@@ si@@ a .
and so some time around 200@@ ,000 years ago , our species confron@@ ted this crisis .
but he looks at the pile of arro@@ wh@@ ea@@ ds , thinks they &apos;re a gi@@ ft , pic@@ ks them up , s@@ miles and wal@@ ks off .
if we go to the island of pap@@ u@@ a new gu@@ ine@@ a , we can find about 800 to 1,000 dist@@ inct human languages , different human languages , spo@@ ken on that island alone .
if 27 individuals from those 27 member states sat around table , speaking their 23 languages , some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of 2@@ 5@@ 3 transl@@ ators to antici@@ p@@ ate all the p@@ air@@ wise possibilities .
what we know about this fo@@ x@@ p@@ 2 and ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als is that they may have had fine motor control of their mou@@ ths -- who knows .
why would we waste this money on you ? &quot; this is what happens to girls in remote areas .
and that is that the central moral challenge of this century is g@@ ender ine@@ qu@@ ity .
the second ten@@ et of &quot; half the sky &quot; is that , let &apos;s put a@@ side the mor@@ ality of all the right and wrong of it all ,
i would say , on the top of the ag@@ enda is sex traff@@ ic@@ king .
the vill@@ agers thought she was cur@@ sed ; they didn &apos;t know what to do with her .
at the time , there was a micro@@ l@@ ending group in the village that gave her a 6@@ 5@@ -@@ dollar lo@@ an .
no matter , she was just deli@@ gh@@ ted to be in school .
i will just leave you with two things .
it says all the same stuff as all the other ones you &apos;ve seen .
cheap meaning a few percent of gdp .
the result of that was pretty dra@@ matic .
ken went and ran his models , and found that it did .
the other problem is they &apos;re right in the o@@ zone layer , and i &apos;d pre@@ fer them above the o@@ zone layer .
this impro@@ ved science and engineering will , whether we like it or not , give us more and more lever@@ age to affect the planet ,
so here &apos;s one way to think about it , which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it &apos;s che@@ aper .
we might decide at that point that even though ge@@ o-@@ engineering was un@@ certain and mor@@ ally un@@ happy , that it &apos;s a lot better than not ge@@ o-@@ engineering .
right now we may think of a big , rich country like the u.s. doing this .
and it &apos;s just another place from which to observe , and the understanding that there are no absolute , all@@ -@@ knowing insi@@ ders . and the out@@ si@@ der can never really reach the core .
and you can see beyond that two-@@ way mirror ju@@ ry ad@@ vis@@ ers standing in a room behind the mirror .
they carry over 60 million simultan@@ e@@ ous voice conversations ,
they fli@@ p the negative .
i trav@@ eled across the united states photograph@@ ing men and women who had been wr@@ ong@@ fully convic@@ ted of cri@@ mes they did not comm@@ it , violent cri@@ mes .
so photograph@@ ing there , i was hoping to high@@ light the ten@@ u@@ ous relationship between truth and fiction , in both his life and in photograph@@ y .
and it re@@ it@@ er@@ ates that dis@@ tor@@ tion is a constant , and our eyes are easily dec@@ e@@ ived .
there is a r@@ ash of suicide in china .
we tend to think of emotions as just feelings .
they like to listen to con@@ son@@ ant mel@@ o@@ dies instead of dis@@ son@@ ant mel@@ o@@ dies .
and we see here the smile .
the other thing is , that a piece of evidence is , is if you look at compu@@ ter@@ ized text analysis of people who comm@@ it suicide , what you find there , and it &apos;s quite interesting , is use of the first person sin@@ gu@@ lar -- &quot; i , &quot; &quot; me , &quot; &quot; my , &quot; not &quot; we &quot; and &quot; us &quot; -- and the letters are less hop@@ eless than they are really alone .
you see mental dis@@ tr@@ ess going up with lower income .
i &apos;m here today to share with you an extraordinary journey -- extraordin@@ arily re@@ war@@ ding journey , actually -- which brought me into training rats to save human lives by det@@ ecting land@@ mines and tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis .
it scr@@ at@@ ches on the soil .
there &apos;s a number of mines placed bl@@ ind@@ ly ,
and even in hi@@ v@@ -@@ posi@@ tives , it makes sense .
so this is really consider@@ able .
it can contem@@ plate the meaning of infin@@ ity , ask questions about the meaning of its own existence , about the nature of god .
it &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s per@@ forming a virtual reality simulation of the other person &apos;s action .
but the same neur@@ on , in some cases , will fire when i simply watch another person being touched .
so , you have a patient with a phan@@ tom lim@@ b . if the arm has been re@@ moved and you have a phan@@ tom , and you watch somebody else being touched , you feel it in your phan@@ tom .
here is a scann@@ ing elec@@ tron micro@@ graph of a grain of pollen .
remember , that thing is just about 30 mic@@ rom@@ eters across .
this is some pollen em@@ be@@ dded in a cot@@ ton shirt , similar to the one that i &apos;m wearing now .
because the personal , as you know , is political .
i &apos;m going to tell you why .
doctor heal@@ y then sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ently became the first female director of our national institu@@ tes of health .
and we said , &quot; we &apos;re going to hypo@@ thes@@ ize that the fat@@ ty pla@@ que in women is actually probably different , and de@@ pos@@ ited differently , than men . &quot;
and if you look carefully , you can see that there &apos;s a black bl@@ ush right there .
these are female and male stem cells .
women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awar@@ eness campaig@@ ns .
here &apos;s our living room , the baby be@@ dro@@ om , kitchen , din@@ ing room and the rest of the house .
dr : he sure n@@ ailed it , didn &apos;t he .
this is a moment , one moment cap@@ tured across multiple cameras .
we call these wor@@ d@@ s@@ cap@@ es .
you have the event structure , the common ground that the words are about , coming out of the television fe@@ eds ;
that dri@@ ves tu@@ ne@@ -@@ in behavior back into mass media , and you have these cycles that drive the over@@ all behavior .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is powerful stuff . &quot;
information designer tom w@@ u@@ je@@ c talks through three areas of the brain that help us understand words , images , feelings , connections . in this short talk from te@@ du , he asks : how can we best engage our brains to help us better understand big ideas ?
and this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .
so the act of engag@@ ing and creating interactive imag@@ ery en@@ riches meaning .
and this is an emerging set of technologies that use lar@@ ge@@ -@@ screen dis@@ plays with intelligent calcul@@ ation in the background to make the invisible visible .
everything in the kitchen was sal@@ vag@@ ed .
so we changed that and put , &quot; this is the famous bud@@ we@@ iser house .
in order to do what i do , you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry .
we &apos;ll go , &quot; ooh , that &apos;s nice . &quot;
and they &apos;re doing a pretty good job there in the forest , working all the by@@ product of their industry -- with os@@ b and parti@@ cle board and so forth and so on -- but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harv@@ est in the forest if consum@@ ers are wast@@ ing the harv@@ est at the point of consumption , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
he said that we have in our no@@ gg@@ in the perfect idea of what we want , and we force environmental resources to ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ate that . so we all have in our head the perfect house , the american dream , which is a house , the dream house .
all we have to do is look at what one company did with car@@ bon@@ ated pr@@ une ju@@ ice .
that exac@@ er@@ b@@ ates and contin@@ ues this model .
i fail all the time , every day ,
everyone i met , i felt i knew them for as long as i could remember .
the show began with tremendous special effects , because there were catastrop@@ hi@@ c climate shif@@ ts -- which sort of sounds interesting as a par@@ alle@@ l to today .
and here are some of the other categ@@ ories , if you look at the whole planet .
and with all the intern@@ al regul@@ ators of my brain dama@@ ged , i felt everything simultan@@ e@@ ously .
i &apos;m not a doctor , so i &apos;m not going to talk about the various sub@@ tests .
but that person could be identi@@ fied as having a learning dis@@ ability .
if that some place else where it bul@@ ges is inside the biggest ner@@ ve in your body , your brain , you get a vas@@ cu@@ lar migr@@ aine .
and other f@@ m devices implan@@ ted in fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps , on cont@@ acting a surface , will send a message back to the sensor@@ y cortex of the brain , so that the person feels a sense of touch .
and then i was ama@@ zed at what role technology played in your re@@ co@@ very .
but there &apos;s millions of dea@@ f people in the world , and the coch@@ l@@ ear im@@ plant has given hearing to thousands of dea@@ f people now .
and one of the questions from which i learned a lot was this one : &quot; which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs ? &quot;
and 196@@ 2 , there was really a group of countries here that was industri@@ alized countries , and they had small families and long lives .
and if we look where the income ends up -- the income --
they could sell their tex@@ tiles -- on equal terms as the people in europe and north america .
you have to invest in health . you have to get kids into scho@@ ol@@ ing .
a search function where we can copy the data up to a se@@ arch@@ able form@@ at and get it out in the world . and what do we hear when we go around ?
i end now with the world . there , the internet is coming .
and thought i would end up , you know , if i was bright enough , maybe getting a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . from cor@@ n@@ ell in or@@ ni@@ tho@@ logy .
so i wanted to work with him , but he didn &apos;t want a former bir@@ d@@ wat@@ cher , and i ended up in cambridge , england .
you know , basically , reading is a good thing ; you get facts .
she was a cr@@ y@@ st@@ allo@@ grap@@ her .
most scientists are really rather du@@ ll .
and that let mar@@ shall ni@@ ren@@ berg , you know , take r@@ na -- syn@@ thetic r@@ na -- put it in a system making protein . he made poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ al@@ an@@ ine , poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ al@@ an@@ ine . so that &apos;s the first cr@@ acking of the genetic code , and it was all over by 196@@ 6 .
you aren &apos;t treated if it &apos;s not dangerous .
were they crazy also , and we didn &apos;t know it ?
so we had a dance , and girls and their fa@@ thers came in multi@@ tu@@ des .
the fa@@ thers and dau@@ gh@@ ters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection , something that a lot of them didn &apos;t even have for a while .
but i &apos;m also sure , pretty sure , that absolutely nobody is thinking of this .
bru@@ ce ay@@ l@@ ward : o@@ ops . j@@ on , polio &apos;s almost been er@@ adi@@ cated .
we &apos;re not trying to get it down to just a few cases , because this disease is like a ro@@ ot fire ; it can explo@@ de again if you don &apos;t s@@ nu@@ ff it out completely .
and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries .
this is a group whose milli@@ on-@@ strong army of volunte@@ ers have been working to er@@ adi@@ cate polio for over 20 years .
these are children like u@@ ma@@ r .
this is the kind of commit@@ ment now we &apos;re seeing to try and reach all of the children we &apos;ve been missing .
and in the last six months , we &apos;ve had less places re@@ infected by polio than at any other time in history .
but the interesting thing is , of those three , india &apos;s looking real good , as you just saw in the data .
&lt; transcript &gt;
so we felt that that day was the day that she really ear@@ ned her name .
d@@ j : and of course , one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who dro@@ w@@ ns the vehicle gets to swim with the cro@@ co@@ di@@ les .
d@@ j : the amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a high@@ light of our career -- is that you never know how it &apos;s going to end .
but nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her , when she started hun@@ ting .
we had to deal with them with respect and celebr@@ ate them .
and that &apos;s probably because we haven &apos;t seen it like we are today .
biolog@@ ist richard d@@ aw@@ kins makes a case for &quot; thinking the im@@ probable &quot; by looking at how the human frame of reference lim@@ its our understanding of the universe .
&quot; tell me , &quot; he asked a friend , &quot; why do people always say , it was natural for man to assu@@ me that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rot@@ ating ? &quot;
un@@ ai@@ ded human intuition scho@@ ol@@ ed in middle world fin@@ ds it hard to believe gal@@ il@@ e@@ o when he tells us a heavy object and a light object , air fri@@ ction a@@ side , would hit the ground at the same instant .
if a neutr@@ in@@ o had a brain , which it evolved in neutr@@ in@@ o-@@ si@@ zed ancest@@ ors , it would say that ro@@ cks really do cons@@ ist of empty space .
middle world -- the range of si@@ zes and spe@@ eds which we have evolved to feel intu@@ i@@ tively comfortable with -- is a bit like the nar@@ row range of the elec@@ trom@@ ag@@ netic spectrum that we see as light of various colors .
i wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand , say , quantum theory , if we brought up children to play computer games , beginning in early childhood , which had a sort of ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe world of ball@@ s going through two sli@@ ts on a screen , a world in which the strange go@@ ings on of quantum mechan@@ ics were en@@ larg@@ ed by the computer &apos;s ma@@ ke@@ -@@ believe , so that they became familiar on the midd@@ le-@@ world scale of the stream .
one of my driving pas@@ sions is this idea of explor@@ ing nature , and trying to find hidden data within nature .
we can also use cy@@ ma@@ tics for heal@@ ing and education .
we can inspire each other .
but the one that &apos;s really been sort of str@@ essing me out , that i haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; cal@@ a a bo@@ ca , gal@@ va@@ o . &quot;
and the first lesson , which i think is a wor@@ th@@ while one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activis@@ m just means ret@@ we@@ eting a phrase .
we end up within these fil@@ ter bu@@ b@@ bles , as my friend el@@ i par@@ iser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
two hop@@ s , you &apos;re in su@@ va , the capit@@ ol of fi@@ j@@ i .
and before you conclu@@ de that this is just a function of american tv news -- which is dre@@ ad@@ ful , and i agree that it &apos;s dre@@ ad@@ ful -- i &apos;ve been ma@@ pping el@@ ite media like the new york times , and i get the same thing .
we started in 2004 .
there &apos;s a group right now in china called y@@ e@@ ey@@ an . and y@@ e@@ ey@@ an is a group of 15@@ 0,000 volunte@@ ers who get online every day .
i don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorith@@ mic process .
d@@ han@@ i has a television show . it &apos;s called &quot; d@@ han@@ i t@@ ack@@ les the globe . &quot;
and it &apos;s not completely gratu@@ it@@ ous , because w@@ ok and roll -- chinese food and japanese fo@@ ods , so it kind of works out .
well , the short answer is , we loc@@ ked up all the japanese during world war ii , including those that made fortune co@@ ok@@ ies , so that &apos;s the time when the chinese moved in , kind of saw a market opportunity and took over .
showed them all the pictures of general t@@ so chicken that i showed you , and they &apos;re like , we don &apos;t know this dish .
and another way that you saw , sort of , this sort of , this anti@@ pathy towards the chinese is through documents like this .
and even the br@@ its have their own version .
so , it wasn &apos;t until the first guy shows up the next day , and they ask him , &quot; where did you get your number from ? &quot;
i was really surprised to discover that , not only in phil@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia , but also in at@@ l@@ anta , because what had happened was that a chinese family had moved from at@@ l@@ anta to -- sorry , from phil@@ ad@@ el@@ ph@@ ia to at@@ l@@ anta , and brought that with them .
and then , we fa@@ st-@@ forward to about 19@@ 32 , when three itali@@ an psy@@ chi@@ a@@ tr@@ ists , who were larg@@ ely treating depression , began to notice among their patients , who were also e@@ pil@@ ep@@ tics , that if they had an e@@ pil@@ ep@@ tic -- a series of e@@ pil@@ ep@@ tic fits , a lot of them in a row -- the depression would very frequ@@ ently lif@@ t .
so people would have a real grand mal se@@ iz@@ ure .
well , you &apos;re in a university medical center , where everybody knows everybody , and it &apos;s perfectly clear to my colleagues , so my re@@ fer@@ r@@ als began to dec@@ re@@ ase .
remember when you were a kid , and you had to step on every line ?
and he went back to them , and they agre@@ ed to do another 10 .
it &apos;s been , as i said , close to 30 years .
there is re@@ co@@ very .
they knew that about 7@@ 5,000 hon@@ dur@@ ans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in hon@@ dur@@ as .
this air@@ port alone co@@ vers more than 100 square kilometers .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are prepar@@ ing the third .
so , you &apos;re calling for a global eth@@ ic .
there is a great story , again , told about richard ni@@ x@@ on .
you have time to al@@ ert one house . what do you do ?
then the question is , how do you make that change happen ?
so , while i can &apos;t automati@@ cally say that britain will rus@@ h to the aid of any citiz@@ en of any country , in danger , i can say that britain is in a position where we &apos;re working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are vic@@ ti@@ ms of either gen@@ o@@ cide or human@@ itarian attack , is something that is accep@@ ted by the whole world .
and i do believe that there is a strong possibility that if we work together , we can get that agre@@ ement to cop@@ enh@@ ag@@ en .
thank you .
and so we get this starting material .
you can add a third dimen@@ sion@@ ality to the film .
so , much like you &apos;re seen at night by a car , then the idea is that you can see , if you illumin@@ ate tissue , you can see dee@@ per parts of tissue because there is that refl@@ ective tape there that is made out of silk .
and so this allows for a controlled deli@@ very of drugs and for re@@ integr@@ ation in the environment in all of these for@@ mat@@ s that you &apos;ve seen .
it knows how much it &apos;s moving .
ever see that little sw@@ is@@ s army k@@ ni@@ fe they have to fight with ?
so thank you all for being a part of it .
and , of course , he never talked about his past life when he was a for@@ ger .
my father , a secret agent ?
it was my grand@@ father who decided they needed fal@@ se documents .
this sense of responsibility for other people &apos;s lives when he was just 17 -- and also his gu@@ il@@ t for being a surviv@@ or , since he had es@@ cap@@ ed the camp when his friends had not -- st@@ ayed with him all his life .
after the liber@@ ation he made fal@@ se pap@@ ers to allow the surviv@@ ors of concentration cam@@ ps to im@@ migr@@ ate to pal@@ est@@ ine before the creation of israel .
with un@@ sha@@ ke@@ able u@@ top@@ i@@ as who managed to make mirac@@ les .
it &apos;s a very important period --
you can take virtu@@ ally any param@@ eter that matters for human well-@@ being -- ni@@ trous oxide , meth@@ ane , de@@ for@@ estation , over@@ fishing land degre@@ dation , loss of species -- they all show the same pattern over the past 200 years .
now we to ask ourselves : which are the large environmental processes that we have to be ste@@ wards of to keep ourselves safe in the ho@@ lo@@ cen@@ e ?
well , there &apos;s no science to suggest . in fact , there is am@@ ple science to indi@@ cate that we can do this transforma@@ tive change , that we have the ability to now move into a new innov@@ ative , a transforma@@ tive g@@ ear , across s@@ cales .
we cannot continue consum@@ ing water as we do today , with 25 percent of world ri@@ vers not even reach@@ ing the ocean .
and i only have 15 minutes , and i see they &apos;re coun@@ ting already .
and also -- advertis@@ ing people do that all the time -- -- and i -- well , what happened is when i went back , it was on the way back to my car , the guy who got hit decided to gr@@ ab a g@@ un -- i don &apos;t know why he had a g@@ un -- and shoot the first person he decided to be his ag@@ gr@@ ess@@ or .
the bon@@ s@@ ai table .
it had a physi@@ cal@@ ity , and you start going dee@@ per and dee@@ per into sort of narr@@ ative that goes this way , towards the image . so this is &quot; monkey with le@@ ic@@ a . &quot;
so they &apos;re called &quot; pictures of chocol@@ ate . &quot;
and i felt that i would have to actually go there and make some earth@@ works myself .
my time is nearly up .
and they are around three billion such letters long .
perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine exis@@ ted .
you have to work very carefully to avoid cont@@ amin@@ ation of experiments with dna from yourself .
so we can then ask for den@@ is@@ ov@@ ans the same things as for the ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als : did they mix with ancest@@ ors of present day people ?
the brilliant play@@ wright , ad@@ ri@@ enne ken@@ ne@@ dy , wrote a volume called &quot; people who led to my plays . &quot; and if i were to write a volume , it would be called , &quot; artists who have led my exhi@@ bi@@ tions &quot; because my work , in understanding art and in understanding culture , has come by following artists , by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are .
this is har@@ lem , actually , on jan@@ u@@ ary 20th , thinking about itself in a very wonderful way . so i work now at the studio museum in har@@ lem , thinking about exhi@@ bi@@ tions there , thinking about what it means to discover art &apos;s possibility .
i am always ama@@ zed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work .
it was a rou@@ tine training jump , like many more i &apos;d done since i became a par@@ a@@ tro@@ op@@ er 27 years before .
if you &apos;re an in@@ board personnel , stand up .
you can &apos;t del@@ ay that much .
and i also was raised with personal examples of leadership .
a 2@@ 2@@ -year-old individual operating alone , thousands of miles from me , has got to communicate to me with confidence .
and yet , we need to have that shared sense .
and every morning in the r@@ anger regi@@ ment , every r@@ anger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them -- says a si@@ x-@@ st@@ anz@@ a r@@ anger cre@@ ed .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
many of the solutions that i and my colleagues see@@ k out and write up every day have some important aspects in common : transpar@@ ency , collaboration , a w@@ ill@@ ing@@ ness to experiment , and an appreci@@ ation of science -- or , more appropri@@ ately , science !
in kenya , mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative curr@@ ency .
camera phones , of course , would be fundamental to the project .
it would be a collabor@@ ative , bot@@ tom@@ -up approach to environmental awar@@ eness and protection , able to respond to emerging concer@@ ns in a smart mo@@ bs kind of way -- and if you need greater sens@@ or den@@ sity , just have more people show up .
i started in 199@@ 9 to try and address this problem with an experiment , which was a very simple experiment in new delhi .
in other words , they were all speaking like james to@@ ol@@ ey .
i mean , if there &apos;s stuff on google , why would you need to stuff it into your head ?
so a 12 year-old girl rai@@ ses her hand and says , literally , &quot; apart from the fact that impro@@ per repli@@ cation of the dna molecule causes genetic disease , we &apos;ve understood nothing else . &quot;
so i came back to new@@ ca@@ st@@ le with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious .
there was photographi@@ c rec@@ all inside the children ,
they &apos;re called so@@ les : self organized learning environments .
a self-@@ organiz@@ ing system is one where a structure appears without expli@@ c@@ it intervention from the outside .
and it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language , and how what we call people so often distances us from them , and makes them little .
and it taught me three lessons that i think are so important for us today , and certainly in the work that i do .
it &apos;s indi@@ gen@@ ous to china and the far east , but given that the pre@@ val@@ ence of malaria is here in africa , pa@@ trick and his colleagues said , &quot; let &apos;s bring it here , because it &apos;s a high valu@@ e-@@ add product . &quot;
un@@ ic@@ ef came forward and said , &quot; we &apos;ll buy most of the nets , and then we &apos;ll give them away , as part of the global fund &apos;s and the u.n. &apos; s commit@@ ment to pregn@@ ant women and children , for free . &quot;
so then , from a policy perspective , when you start with the market , we have a choice .
i &apos;m going to be talking a little bit about music , machines and life .
so we have this 10@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ squ@@ ar@@ e-@@ foot war@@ e@@ house we were using , divi@@ ded between two flo@@ ors .
and it &apos;s actually in the machine .
so you put that up front so that , if it fai@@ ls , at least you know you don &apos;t have to res@@ et the whole thing .
&lt; transcript &gt;
out of them : brain , heart , li@@ ver , you get the picture , but out of your cells .
because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer .
and this really is a so@@ ber@@ ing picture upon realiz@@ ing that we , humans , are in charge of life on earth ; we &apos;re like the ca@@ pr@@ icious go@@ ds of old gre@@ ek my@@ ths , kind of playing with life -- and not a great deal of wisdom inj@@ ected into it .
vehic@@ les of all different kinds , usually with some electron@@ ics or electric power systems in them . i find they &apos;re all the same ,
for those who live on the main@@ land , it was tough being away from home .
ok .
the one final bit of s@@ par@@ k@@ le we &apos;ll put in at the very end here is an ut@@ ter@@ ly im@@ practical flight vehicle , which is a little or@@ ni@@ th@@ op@@ ter w@@ ing@@ -@@ fl@@ apping device that -- ru@@ b@@ ber@@ -@@ band powered -- that we &apos;ll show you .
a mar@@ su@@ pi@@ al is a mam@@ mal with a pou@@ ch like a k@@ ang@@ ar@@ o@@ o .
and yet , she was feeding three little baby tas@@ mani@@ an dev@@ ils in her pou@@ ch .
and the answer came from studying the tas@@ mani@@ an dev@@ il cancer &apos;s dna .
it &apos;s not con@@ str@@ ained by living within the body that gave rise to it .
and this is a photograph of dr. sou@@ th@@ am in 195@@ 7 inj@@ ecting cancer into a volunte@@ er , who in this case was an in@@ mate in o@@ hi@@ o state pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary .
well , the conventi@@ onal approach to post-@@ conflict situations has res@@ ted on , on kind of , three principles .
why does the politics get easier ?
post-@@ conflict economic re@@ co@@ very is a slow process .
so that &apos;s idea one :
governments in post-@@ conflict situation often respond by pu@@ ff@@ ing up the civil service .
we need fir@@ ms . the fir@@ ms have gone away .
they would be co-@@ br@@ and@@ ed as being done by the post-@@ conflict government , in the country .
where would that leave us ?
now , anybody has that capacity , which previ@@ ously was res@@ tric@@ ted by price just to a few actors . if they have the price of en@@ try into an internet ca@@ fe -- the last time i looked , it was something like a pound an hour -- and if you have sky@@ pe , it &apos;s free .
indeed , if you can learn to use more soft power , you can save a lot on car@@ r@@ ots and sti@@ cks .
so we &apos;ve got , what , 17 more years to go or so before china &apos;s bigger .
the answer is it matters quite a lot .
the bottom board of this three-@@ dimensional , the board of trans@@ national relations , things that cross bor@@ ders outside the control of governments , things like climate change , drug trade , financial flo@@ ws , pand@@ em@@ ics , all these things that cross bor@@ ders outside the control of governments , there nobody &apos;s in charge .
so if one looks at the stat@@ ements that have been made about this , i am im@@ pressed that when h@@ ill@@ ary cl@@ int@@ on described the foreign policy of the obama administration , she said that the foreign policy of the obama administration was going to be smart power , as she put it , &quot; using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box . &quot; and if we &apos;re going to deal with these two great power shif@@ ts that i &apos;ve described , the power shift represent@@ ed by transition among states , the power shift represent@@ ed by diff@@ usion of power away from all states , we &apos;re going to have to develop a new narr@@ ative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strate@@ gies of smart power .
s : i don &apos;t ever want to let my country down .
s : i want to change my life !
i called my wife les@@ lie , and i said , &quot; you know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
i said , &quot; what is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; a job . &quot;
he pro@@ posed the film to me , and i said , &quot; yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local tv , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot;
and really , i feel as though , when i see the film -- i have a ges@@ ture she does , like this -- i feel like i am a continu@@ ation of her ges@@ ture .
there &apos;s a prime minister , secre@@ t@@ ary of state , minister of defen@@ se and a c@@ f@@ o , or comp@@ tr@@ ol@@ ler .
so i &apos;ll just share with you ...
she mar@@ ched into the oil field reser@@ ves , surr@@ ounded it , without fir@@ ing a shot , and sec@@ u@@ red it and held it .
so you have a little bit more thought before you comm@@ it to combat .
and i can &apos;t design that , i can &apos;t plan that , and i can &apos;t even test that .
i didn &apos;t know what they were doing . i &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
ar@@ v@@ ind gu@@ p@@ ta : turning tr@@ ash into to@@ ys for learning
it was a very small village -- a wee@@ kly ba@@ z@@ a@@ ar where people , just once in a week , they put in all the v@@ ats .
because if they put tiles on top , it &apos;s just going to crash .
and we have a s@@ log@@ an that the best thing a child can do with a to@@ y is to break it@@ . it &apos;s a very kind of provo@@ ca@@ tive st@@ atement -- this old bicy@@ cle tube and this old plastic &#91; un@@ clear &#93; this f@@ illing cap will go very s@@ nu@@ g@@ ly into an old bicy@@ cle tube .
and you put a little fan here .
you can see a g@@ lea@@ m in their eye .
this is stri@@ ps of vel@@ cr@@ o , this is my drawing s@@ late , and this is my drawing p@@ en , which is basically a film box .
it &apos;s a great cricket cap .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so i &apos;m going to talk about some projects that have explo@@ red these ideas .
so now i want to go onto talking about the lin@@ ear@@ -@@ to-@@ clo@@ se@@ d-@@ loo@@ p idea .
and we &apos;d also have a coffee shop , and the waste gr@@ ains from that could be used as a sub@@ str@@ ate for growing mus@@ h@@ rooms .
and the effect of this is that as the dro@@ pl@@ ets start to form on the bu@@ mps , they stay in ti@@ ght , sph@@ eri@@ cal bea@@ ds , which means they &apos;re much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole be@@ et@@ le &apos;s sh@@ ell .
we &apos;ll be able to make use of all that to ev@@ a@@ por@@ ate more s@@ ea@@ water and enh@@ ance the res@@ tor@@ ative benefits .
and i fir@@ m@@ ly believe that studying the way nature sol@@ ves problems will provide a lot of the solutions .
i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games .
the first way is that they &apos;re actually able to resol@@ ve small detail in the context of clu@@ t@@ ter , and though that means being able to read the fine print on a pres@@ cri@@ ption rather than using magnifi@@ er gl@@ asses , you can actually do it with just your ey@@ es@@ ight .
you &apos;re also keeping track of the pe@@ des@@ tri@@ an , the running dog , and that &apos;s how you can actually be safe driving , right ?
we obviously don &apos;t ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have . that would be a little
i &apos;m much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forc@@ ing you to play an action game , i can actually change your vision for the better , whether you want to play that action game or not , right ?
that &apos;s the chocol@@ ate side of the equ@@ ation .
and during that time , i actually lost more rel@@ atives , as well as the teachers who taught me , to hiv / aids .
it &apos;s the idea of compu@@ tation .
let &apos;s just run all possible programs of the particular type that we &apos;re looking at .
well , then i got to thinking : this scientific paradig@@ m of mine suggests something different --
or let &apos;s try asking about , i don &apos;t know , the international space station .
but , in many ways , we &apos;re still at the very beginning with wol@@ fr@@ am alph@@ a .
here &apos;s a big website where we &apos;ve been collec@@ ting lots of edu@@ ca@@ tional and other demonstr@@ ations about lots of kinds of things .
well , then the universe has to evol@@ ve by appl@@ ying little rules that progr@@ essi@@ vely up@@ date this network .
so , that was , fair to say , an aston@@ ishing talk .
these people are t@@ all .
because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any property , and by de@@ fau@@ lt , everything in my family anyway bel@@ on@@ gs to my father , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual cer@@ em@@ on@@ y happens , we were d@@ ancing , having excit@@ ement , and through all the night we did not sleep .
i told him , &quot; well , i want to go to where you are , &quot; because this man looked very happy , and i ad@@ mi@@ red that .
he gave me a list of another 15 men that i went -- 16 more men -- every single morning i went and vis@@ ited them .
she &apos;s be@@ aten .
as a new d@@ a@@ wn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .
we &apos;ve ques@@ tion@@ ed where we &apos;re going .
and of course our ban@@ ks did as well , as did our fe@@ der@@ al government .
i &apos;ll give you some examples . lets talk about denti@@ sts , vas@@ ect@@ om@@ ies , g@@ uns and shark att@@ acks . okay ?
but seriously , we also have this phenomenon on ma@@ dis@@ on av@@ en@@ ue and in other places , where people are actually walking out of lux@@ ury bou@@ tiques with ordinary , sort of gener@@ ic paper bag@@ s to hi@@ de the brand pur@@ ch@@ ases .
and , as a result , businesses must provide not only value , but values .
did you know that 6@@ 8 percent of americans now carry a library card ?
in my book i talked about the fact that 7@@ 2 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company , versus 15 percent on advertis@@ ing .
so what cre@@ denti@@ als does z@@ ag@@ at &apos;s have ?
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and pr@@ aise really does have to be gen@@ u@@ ine , but she takes responsibility for that .
how can we have world peace with different cultures , different languages ?
and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of story@@ telling and also some super@@ natural creatures called the d@@ j@@ in@@ ni .
it will dry up inside .
what she didn &apos;t know was that i thought my life was terri@@ bly boring , and the last thing i wanted to do was to write about myself .
in my mi@@ d-@@ tw@@ enti@@ es , i moved to ist@@ an@@ bu@@ l , the city i adore .
but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the ton@@ gue .
if you &apos;re a woman writer from the musli@@ m world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of musli@@ m women and , pre@@ fer@@ ably , the un@@ happy stories of un@@ happy musli@@ m women .
i want to love and celebr@@ ate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
we know a lot about each other , or so we think --
i think it was a wonderful paradig@@ m shift .
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity .
now , american copyright and pat@@ ent laws run coun@@ ter to this notion that we build on the work of others .
that is all there is to it . apple has pat@@ ent@@ ed this .
&quot; i jump &apos; em from other writ@@ ers but i arr@@ ange &apos; em my own way . &quot; i think this is mostly what we do .
and it &apos;s one of the yellow set of blo@@ bs around the big yellow blo@@ b .
so , to find strong evidence of liquid , po@@ ols of liquid , bene@@ ath the surface of a moon 7@@ 50 million miles away from the earth is really quite ast@@ oun@@ ding .
a famous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that saved 196@@ 8 , which was a tur@@ bu@@ lent year -- the student ri@@ ots in paris , the he@@ ight of the viet@@ nam war .
and now , this is a picture of atoms in the sun &apos;s atmosphere absor@@ bing light .
so that star is also 50 million light years away .
it looks like satur@@ n because , of course , it is .
it &apos;s been said that astronom@@ y &apos;s a hum@@ bling and character@@ -@@ building experience .
he says , &quot; ok , but what is the name of that block ? &quot;
in most music , we think of the &quot; one &quot; as the down@@ beat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
it helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with .
so let me fa@@ st-@@ forward through the rest of my day .
you can down@@ load it , inst@@ all it in fi@@ re@@ fo@@ x , to see who is trac@@ king you across the web and following you through the digital wo@@ ods .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and so , on my 2@@ 7@@ th birth@@ day i decided , because i argu@@ ed so much and i talk so much , that i was going to stop speaking for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest .
you don ’ t … ?
they saw that i was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
no one was interested in oil sp@@ ills .
how could that be , how could that be ?
it took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , i had become a pris@@ on@@ er .
because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
i was myself pregn@@ ant while i was doing the research for the book .
it even makes its cri@@ es sound like the mother &apos;s language , which may further end@@ ear the baby to the mother , and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its n@@ ative language .
will it be born into a world of ab@@ un@@ dance or scar@@ city ?
this keeps the f@@ et@@ us alive in the shor@@ t-@@ term , but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs , de@@ priv@@ ed early on , become more suscepti@@ ble to disease .
what looks like patho@@ logy to us may actually be a useful adap@@ tation in some circum@@ st@@ ances .
it was the po@@ et sam@@ u@@ el ta@@ y@@ lo@@ r col@@ er@@ id@@ ge who first sugges@@ ted this re@@ cep@@ tive state of mind .
he said that magici@@ ans deli@@ ber@@ ately explo@@ it the way their audi@@ ences think .
we po@@ lish the r@@ ough ed@@ ges of our lives so that they feel whole .
one of them was : why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds spe@@ eding up the euro@@ star train when , for about 10 percent of that money , you could have top super@@ models , male and female , ser@@ ving free ch@@ at@@ eau pe@@ tr@@ us to all the pass@@ eng@@ ers for the entire dur@@ ation of the journey ?
it &apos;s the lif@@ t , it &apos;s a series of but@@ tons in the lif@@ t .
now , here &apos;s another thing that happens , which is what i call sometimes &quot; termin@@ al 5 syndrome , &quot; which is that big , expensive things get big , high@@ ly@@ -@@ intelligent attention , and they &apos;re great , and termin@@ al 5 is absolutely mag@@ nific@@ ent , until you get down to the small detail , the us@@ ability , which is the sign@@ age , which is catastrop@@ hi@@ c .
and they do it three times as often . &quot;
i thought it was very in@@ dec@@ ent of ac@@ cent@@ ure to dit@@ ch ti@@ ger wo@@ ods in such a sort of hur@@ ried and h@@ ast@@ y way .
it all became music to me .
and it &apos;s mostly advertis@@ ed for its motion sens@@ or cap@@ abilities : so you can s@@ wing a ten@@ n@@ is rac@@ k@@ et , or hit a bas@@ e@@ ball b@@ at .
for the second dem@@ o , i have this wi@@ i remote
and i also was taught , cou@@ pl@@ ed with that , that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job , appar@@ ently , to help .
i started to feel gu@@ il@@ ty for my own relative wealth , because i wasn &apos;t doing more , appar@@ ently , to make things better .
think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services t@@ ai@@ lo@@ red to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day .
they might be able to buy mos@@ qui@@ to nets . maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel sec@@ ure . maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when i came as their gu@@ est and that made them feel proud .
let &apos;s start for real . &quot; that was our offici@@ al laun@@ ch .
the first one is , as i mentioned , entrepren@@ eur@@ ship was a new idea to me .
that &apos;s around 1@@ 30 billion dollars a year --
thanks .
if we extra@@ pol@@ ate back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago .
the first is that we have fo@@ ss@@ ils of al@@ ga@@ e from 3@@ .@@ 5 billion years ago .
thank you for listening .
so this is a project i &apos;m working on , and this is a series of front co@@ vers to down@@ grade our super , hy@@ per — to down@@ grade our super , hyper@@ -@@ mobile phones into the essence of their function .
these lo@@ vely patterns . and then this last one , one of my favor@@ ites , this pin@@ whe@@ el design .
bin@@ go ! now i &apos;m told that &apos;s not just a s@@ qui@@ d phenomenon with males , but i don &apos;t know .
i thought it was all graph@@ ics -- so here it is in reverse .
after i was invited by ted , i did some di@@ gg@@ ing , because that &apos;s what we do , to know about my ho@@ st .
but you could ask , how could these large mam@@ m@@ als live in this desert environment ?
in a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3@@ .@@ 3 million years , but the labor was very long .
and more interesting , however , is the brain in this child was still growing .
up to now , the knowledge that we had about our ancest@@ ors came essentially from adult individuals because the fo@@ ss@@ ils , the baby fo@@ ss@@ ils , were missing .
thank you .
as a result , we have gar@@ b@@ age pat@@ ches the size of tw@@ ic@@ e-@@ texas .
but the s@@ arg@@ as@@ so sea , the same way it ag@@ gre@@ gates s@@ arg@@ assu@@ m we@@ ed , actually is pul@@ ling in the plastic from throughout the region .
many species are hea@@ ded through this region , which is why there &apos;s been so much attention put into conservation of the eastern trop@@ ical pacific seas@@ cape .
at the same time we &apos;re saying , &quot; yes , we need more . we need to move forward . &quot;
why do people succe@@ ed ? is it because they &apos;re smart ? or are they just lucky ? ne@@ i@@ ther . analy@@ st richard st@@ . john con@@ den@@ ses years of intervie@@ ws into an un@@ miss@@ able 3@@ -@@ minute sli@@ des@@ how on the real secrets of success .
now it &apos;s not always easy to push yourself , and that &apos;s why they invented mothers .
and what m@@ iller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shor@@ tly after he died .
now a lot of you are probably familiar with de@@ b ro@@ y who , back in mar@@ ch , demonstr@@ ated how he was able to analy@@ ze more than 9@@ 0,000 hours of home video .
in other words , to keep operating at our current level , we need 50 percent more earth than we &apos;ve got .
that &apos;s all true .
now we &apos;ve had 50 years of war@@ n@@ ings .
i want to do so because , in my view , the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question .
yes , things will get ug@@ ly , and it will happen soon -- certainly in our lifetime -- but we are more than capable of getting through everything that &apos;s coming .
and this is where you come in .
&lt; transcript &gt;
he gives half of them vit@@ am@@ in b@@ 12 .
i see it in our business leaders .
and what we learned is c@@ es@@ ar &apos;s work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .
and we have a probl@@ em@@ -@@ solving technique that works .
now if you as@@ cri@@ be to the god complex , what you do is you find yourself a little god .
that is a huge failure rate .
we &apos;re going to test them out . they &apos;ll probably all fail .
you &apos;re killing people with your clinical trials . you need to sh@@ ut it down now .
his friend , gor@@ o sh@@ im@@ ur@@ a -- who worked on the mathematics with him -- many decades later , refl@@ ected on tan@@ i@@ y@@ ama &apos;s life .
the government , mean@@ while , has been acting like s@@ anta cl@@ au@@ s .
and you &apos;ve got to start ban@@ ishing a word that &apos;s called &quot; enti@@ t@@ lement . &quot;
that &apos;s the short term . that &apos;s the fla@@ me part .
tw@@ ent@@ y-@@ one countries came together . do@@ z@@ ens of te@@ ams .
and we can do it with other things .
this is not an intelligence tur@@ ing rest , but this is as close as you can get to a physical tur@@ ing test .
and , of course , the future is looking back 200 years , because next week is the 200@@ th annivers@@ ary of darwin &apos;s birth .
once upon a time , there was a dre@@ ad disease that aff@@ lic@@ ted children .
for many years this went along , and everything was fine .
if you put a child in a car seat , 18@@ .@@ 2 percent of the children die .
it &apos;s kind of an interesting logic , i think , that people use . and the other logic , they say , &quot; well , the government wouldn &apos;t have told us &#91; to &#93; use them if they weren &apos;t much better . &quot;
these are three-@@ year-old du@@ m@@ mi@@ es , by the way .
so , i &apos;ll show you the si@@ x-@@ year-old cr@@ ash@@ es as well .
ok , and most of them would not come back , but some of them would come back .
kevin kel@@ ly on the next 5,000 days of the web
if there is only one machine , and our little hand@@ hel@@ ds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines , but that we &apos;re basically construc@@ ting a single , global machine .
so to a first appro@@ x@@ ima@@ tion , we have these things -- tw@@ enty pet@@ a@@ her@@ t@@ z syn@@ ap@@ se fir@@ ings .
but everything , all the cameras , and the micro@@ phones , and the sens@@ ors in cars and everything is connected to this machine .
the immedi@@ acy , the authenti@@ cation , the person@@ alization . the media wants to be liquid . the reason why things are free is so that you can manipul@@ ate them , not so that they are &quot; free &quot; as in &quot; be@@ er , &quot; but &quot; free &quot; as in &quot; freedom . &quot;
now we have pages -- the unit has been resol@@ ved into pages , so one page lin@@ ks to another page .
why should you be doing that ? you should just do that once , and it should know who all your friends are .
and we kind of object at first , saying , &quot; oh , that &apos;s awful . &quot;
and i don &apos;t know what else to call it , than the one .
and after about five years of doing this , i was ar@@ res@@ ted for kid@@ n@@ apping .
i understand how someone &apos;s brain , how someone &apos;s mind can come to the place where it makes sense --
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and it &apos;s not based on an a prior@@ i notion .
because one of the issues today is that the economic ag@@ gre@@ gate is driving the development ag@@ gre@@ gate , and as the ag@@ gre@@ gates get larger we require more and more complex investi@@ gation processes to solve these problems .
again , it &apos;s a very , very simple notion .
it &apos;s a wrong attitude , actually , because the hybri@@ d is probably more interesting .
i have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just ac@@ com@@ mod@@ ates x , y and z function .
one ent@@ ers the building as it lif@@ ts off the ground , and it becomes part of the idea .
that refl@@ ect even rus@@ ticated st@@ on@@ ework , but which were em@@ be@@ dded with frag@@ ments of the constitu@@ tion , which were part of the little process , all set on a pl@@ int@@ h that defined it from the community .
we talk about ourselves as om@@ ni@@ v@@ or@@ es .
we walked out of africa two times .
and two ta@@ stes which protect you -- bit@@ ter and s@@ our , which are against pois@@ on@@ ous and rot@@ ten material .
now 150 years ago , anatom@@ ists described very , very carefully -- here is a model of a wall of a gu@@ t .
it &apos;s called the sub@@ su@@ mption architecture .
so now back to the cooking question and back to the design .
anthropo@@ logist w@@ ade dav@@ is mus@@ es on the worldwide web of belief and ritu@@ al that makes us human . he shares brea@@ th@@ taking photos and stories of the el@@ der brothers , a group of si@@ er@@ ra n@@ ev@@ ada indi@@ ans whose spiritu@@ al practice holds the world in balance .
but the cor@@ ol@@ lar@@ y of that is that , if we all are brothers and s@@ ist@@ ers and share the same genetic material , all human populations share the same ra@@ w human geni@@ us , the same intellectual acu@@ ity .
and with the bl@@ essing of tr@@ ul@@ shi@@ k r@@ in@@ po@@ che , we began a pil@@ gri@@ mage to a curious destin@@ ation , ac@@ compan@@ i@@ ed by a great doctor .
i only managed to do it by che@@ wing more co@@ ca leaves in one day than anyone in the 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ year history of the plant .
values that maint@@ ain the proposition that their pr@@ ay@@ ers , and their pr@@ ay@@ ers alone , maint@@ ain the cos@@ mic balance .
not simply to the fl@@ an@@ ks of the mountains , but to the very ic@@ ed pea@@ ks which are the des@@ tiny of the pil@@ gri@@ ms .
i was up in the high arc@@ tic to tell a story about global warming , inspired in part by the former vice president &apos;s wonderful book .
this does not have to happen .
perhaps even worse is when it fin@@ ds its way into our oceans , like in the great plastic gy@@ re , where these materials are being mechan@@ ically broken into smaller and smaller bits , but they &apos;re not really going away .
now , my@@ cel@@ ium is an amazing material , because it &apos;s a self-@@ assembl@@ ing material .
our entire facilit@@ y is com@@ pris@@ ed of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting in@@ do@@ ors in the dark , qui@@ et@@ ly self-@@ assembl@@ ing materials -- and everything from building materials to , in this case , a pack@@ aging corner block .
natural pol@@ ym@@ ers , well ... i think that &apos;s what &apos;s most important , because these pol@@ ym@@ ers have been tried and tes@@ ted in our ecosystem for the last billion years , in everything from mus@@ h@@ rooms to cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans .
well , except they &apos;ve been pre-@@ war@@ ned now , and they &apos;ll know you &apos;re making it up .
so suppose we to@@ ss a coin repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly .
who thinks that c is true -- that , on average , it &apos;ll take less time to see hea@@ d-@@ tail@@ -@@ head than hea@@ d-@@ tail@@ -@@ tail ?
and you keep to@@ ss@@ ing , to wait for the next head , to get excited .
and i will give you two little s@@ ni@@ pp@@ ets -- two examples -- of projects we &apos;re involved in in my group in oxford , both of which i think are rather exciting .
so a natural answer is 99 percent .
each of those explan@@ ations has a likely bit and an un@@ likely bit .
and secon@@ dly , it &apos;s pal@@ p@@ ably fal@@ se .
and then if she were trying to kill the children , she succe@@ e@@ ded .
to go back to the legal context , at the s@@ ally clar@@ k trial all of the law@@ yers just accep@@ ted what the expert said .
the smo@@ ke al@@ arm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives , worldwide .
okay , two more points . every year in the us@@ a , roughly 2,@@ 500 children are ad@@ mit@@ ted to emer@@ gency rooms for sho@@ ck and burn inju@@ ries related to electrical re@@ cep@@ tac@@ les . and this is crazy .
and when it comes to sensor@@ y res@@ tor@@ ation , we &apos;re still very far away from being able to provide beauty .
ow@@ l . ow@@ l .
girl : yes i do . i remember writing every chap@@ ter .
when you hear music , if it doesn &apos;t sound good , what &apos;s the point ?
if we could play these two sound cli@@ ps in succ@@ ession .
because his grave was ex@@ hum@@ ed .
and it was absolutely wonderful .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
you get now a dna st@@ a@@ pler instead . these are the kind of molecular programs that we want to be able to write , but the problem is , we don &apos;t know the machine language of proteins . we don &apos;t have a comp@@ il@@ er for proteins .
and if it &apos;s the case that we can reach that level of complexity , if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good , then that will truly be magic . thank you very much .
you could even hear it .
they meant to rule by means of re@@ pression .
the g@@ un may be one of the most important instruments of peace and st@@ ability that we have in this world .
with trade , there &apos;s mutu@@ al inter@@ depend@@ ency and mutu@@ al gain between parties .
i stand for this soldi@@ er who suff@@ ered parti@@ al hearing loss and sustain@@ ed perman@@ ent inju@@ ries to her leg , which was hit by a ro@@ cket on a mission in afghanistan .
and then from that point on , you &apos;re basically falling .
to ex@@ ecu@@ te it effectively .
we &apos;ve heard a lot about the promise of technology , and the per@@ il .
and if you ask me , will the price of google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now , that &apos;s very hard to say .
so the first step in biological evolution , the evolution of dna -- actually it was r@@ na came first -- took billions of years , but then evolution used that informa@@ ti@@ on-@@ processing back@@ bone to bring on the next stage .
and that &apos;s exponenti@@ al growth through five different paradig@@ ms .
as we make them smaller and less expensive , the elec@@ trons have less distance to travel .
they didn &apos;t get diab@@ et@@ es ; they didn &apos;t get heart disease ; they lived 20 percent longer ; they got the health benefits of cal@@ or@@ ic res@@ tric@@ tion without the res@@ tric@@ tion .
there &apos;s one nan@@ o-@@ engine@@ ered device that cu@@ res type 1 diab@@ et@@ es . it &apos;s blood cel@@ l-@@ si@@ zed .
we &apos;ve had produc@@ tivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour of labor in the last 50 years .
you can go there with other people , have any kind of experience with anyone invol@@ ving all of the sen@@ ses .
it &apos;s like a water do@@ w@@ sing device .
and sometimes a really is connected to b ,
this is the only equ@@ ation in the talk by the way .
just sh@@ out out anything you see .
an increase of dop@@ amine caused subj@@ ects to see more patterns than those that did not rece@@ ive the dop@@ amine .
the other one also , but maybe too many patterns .
the impossible cr@@ ate illusion .
well , we know exactly where it happens , in the tempor@@ al lo@@ be , right across , sort of above your ear there ,
but this is a pattern det@@ ection problem , isn &apos;t it ?
you get a hypo@@ x@@ ia , or a lower oxygen .
girl : okay .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on gal@@ ap@@ agos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
and i went s@@ ail@@ ing on it , and we did surve@@ ys throughout the southern south china sea and especially the j@@ av@@ a sea .
and the difference then , they perce@@ ive as a loss .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insi@@ ght that it provi@@ des , which en@@ ables them to res@@ et their bas@@ el@@ ine .
and most dun@@ g be@@ et@@ les actually w@@ ra@@ p it into a pack@@ age of some sort .
and what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball ?
how far can we push them before they will re@@ orient@@ ate themselves ?
and what &apos;s of interest here is that little brain is quite cool .
and he doesn &apos;t like this first position , but he comes up with a second position , and about 50 minutes later , that n@@ est is finished , and he heads off to for@@ age and pro@@ vision at a pile of dry dun@@ g p@@ ell@@ ets .
shame .
i didn &apos;t do it as well , but we managed to get you@@ ss@@ ou n &apos;@@ d@@ our , sting , tr@@ acy chap@@ man , and bru@@ ce spr@@ ing@@ ste@@ en to go &apos; round the world for am@@ nes@@ ty , and it was an amazing experience .
the one who was de@@ fil@@ ing me then left me and went to rap@@ e ev@@ el@@ yn .
and we &apos;ve also been trying to get computers out to the world , so that groups can communicate much more effectively , campaign much more effectively , but now we have the wonderful possibility , which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it , because that is cheap ; it &apos;s u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous ; and it &apos;s moving fast all around the world -- and it &apos;s very exciting for us .
what we get from this adv@@ enture is just she@@ er joy , and joy , after all , is the end of life .
the ice is always moving , breaking up , dri@@ f@@ ting around , re@@ free@@ zing , so the scen@@ ery that i saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me . no one else will ever , could ever , possibly see the vie@@ ws , the vis@@ tas , that i saw for 10 weeks .
it is , argu@@ ably , the most aud@@ aci@@ ous end@@ e@@ av@@ or of that ed@@ war@@ di@@ an golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from s@@ cur@@ v@@ y to solar pan@@ els , that it was high time someone had a go at fin@@ ishing the job .
so i think it &apos;s safe to say i know a little bit about the process of pit@@ ching .
if you &apos;re not passionate about your own company , why on earth should anyone else be passionate ?
and you have the char@@ is@@ ma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead , to inspire them , to motiv@@ ate them to be part of your team .
you can &apos;t say , &quot; hey , i &apos;ve got high integr@@ ity , invest in me ! &quot; right ?
you stop , you &apos;ve got to figure it out .
anything that makes me think . anything that i don &apos;t understand , where i have to make the lea@@ p myself , in my own head , is going to stop the flow of the presentation .
no , they &apos;re not .
this is not a fi@@ ve-@@ minute pit@@ ch . this is , you know , two sent@@ ences .
whether you have a distribution relationship with somebody , you know , you have a producing partner . or , you know , again , val@@ id@@ ation .
two million at 100,000 .
power@@ point has this built into every copy of power@@ point that &apos;s shi@@ pped .
you &apos;re making a connection with your audience over here , and you always want to do a one-@@ on-@@ one connection .
where do we r@@ ank three weeks ago in another report by the o@@ ec@@ d ?
in case some of you for@@ got what play is , this is what play looks like .
but we need to remember that bab@@ a &apos;s been infected by the serious mem@@ e for 45 years .
in social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
these are the benefits to play .
it impro@@ ves our ability to learn .
i asked them all .
i &apos;m going to let you make decisions . i &apos;m going to em@@ power you ,
what we need is a players &apos; u@@ pris@@ ing .
all of these things were made during the last 75 years .
as i said , i started to do these things 75 years ago .
so he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and explained to me that what i did now in my shop was an an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that i rather should join the factory .
and among other things , other countries i worked , was in the sovi@@ et union , where i worked from &apos; 32 to &apos; 3@@ 7 -- actually , to &apos; 3@@ 6 .
you &apos;ve got to make something good out of something bad .
it &apos;s the only copy i had . pieces of it .
alis@@ a vol@@ k@@ man : so this is where our story begins -- the dra@@ matic moments of the birth of our first son , dec@@ lan .
r@@ g : when we lo@@ wer@@ ed the glo@@ ss@@ y par@@ ent@@ ing magazine that we were looking at , with these beautiful images , and looked at the scene in our actual living room , it looked a little bit more like this .
and you can see , our eyes were g@@ listening .
a@@ v : i don &apos;t want to emb@@ arr@@ ass him too much . but i am going to give him three seconds .
so your 5@@ 8 percent of mothers surve@@ yed report feelings of lon@@ el@@ iness .
and i felt like i happened upon this secret society of women that i now was a part of , which was reas@@ sur@@ ing and also really concer@@ ning .
there &apos;s something missing from these studies .
there &apos;s another factor in our case .
&lt; transcript &gt;
was a bel@@ o@@ ved pi@@ an@@ ist , maybe the great cul@@ t pi@@ an@@ ist of the tw@@ enti@@ eth century .
ultimately , i started with the experience .
your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement , you know .
we &apos;ve seen all these &quot; star tre@@ ks , &quot; and they &apos;re all ho@@ lo@@ dec@@ k ep@@ is@@ odes as well .
ge@@ off mul@@ g@@ an : post-@@ crash , inves@@ ting in a better world
and when people aren &apos;t allowed to be useful , they soon think that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
when times are hard , people have to do things for themselves , and right across the world , oxford , om@@ a@@ ha , om@@ s@@ k , you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farm@@ ing , people taking over land , taking over ro@@ o@@ fs , turning b@@ arg@@ es into tempor@@ ary far@@ ms .
on what people do to other people , often one to one , rather than simply selling them a product .
and some are quite struc@@ tural , like social impact bon@@ ds where you raise money to invest in diver@@ ting teen@@ agers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital , and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are .
i &apos;m not sugges@@ ting the crow@@ ds are about to stor@@ m the barri@@ ca@@ des and string up every investment ban@@ ker from the near@@ est lam@@ p@@ post , though that might be quite temp@@ ting .
so all the way over on the left of this graph , what you see is many o@@ ec@@ d countries saving over a quar@@ ter of their gdp every year , and some o@@ ec@@ d countries saving over a third of their gdp per year .
it &apos;s simply not per@@ mis@@ sible in english to say , &quot; it rain tomorrow . &quot;
and interes@@ t@@ ingly enough , there are po@@ ck@@ ets of futu@@ reless language spea@@ kers situ@@ ated all over the world .
combine that with a world value surve@@ y , which mea@@ sures the political opin@@ ions and , fortunately for me , the sav@@ ings behavi@@ ors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world .
and that &apos;s exactly what we find .
but it was she who ended up learning all the arab@@ ic words for the local plants , as well as their uses -- medi@@ cin@@ al uses , cos@@ me@@ tics , cooking , her@@ bal .
so everybody wants to have an english education , naturally .
and so light sh@@ one upon the dark ages of europe .
let me tell you a story about two scientists , two english scientists .
use it to spread great ideas .
and brian all@@ en was able , in a mirac@@ ul@@ ous flight , to get the go@@ ss@@ am@@ er al@@ ba@@ tro@@ ss across the english channel , and we won the 10@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ pound , 200@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar prize for that . and when all expen@@ ses were paid , the deb@@ t was hand@@ led , and everything was fine .
and they form little groups , all fighting with each other , and when i leave , two hours later , most of them are saying about 2 billion people , and they don &apos;t have any clu@@ e about how to get down to 2 billion , nor do i , but i think they &apos;re right and this is a serious problem .
it s@@ ends high-@@ resol@@ ution video pictures back to the oper@@ ator .
this was flying around in the party last night , and -- -- you can see how it just can fly around , and you can sp@@ y on anybody you want .
so the coffee cu@@ p , or the cu@@ p with a hand@@ le , is one of the tools used by society to maint@@ ain public health .
and , since this is coming from a moral philosop@@ her , the fourth would be that it &apos;s part of god &apos;s plan for the universe .
here &apos;s another example , which i put up because it &apos;s an example of really important current science .
it starts with bin@@ ary .
so that &apos;s the next layer of simpli@@ city , and , in fact , integr@@ ated circuits are really simple in the sense that they , in general , work really well .
that is , you can st@@ ack them .
one of them is from mr. einstein ,
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and he was dis@@ cont@@ ent@@ ed with the state of people &apos;s practice of the bu@@ ddhis@@ t religion in india at that time .
again , no vision of mai@@ tre@@ ya after nine years .
so he starts to do that . he can &apos;t gr@@ ab the ma@@ gg@@ ots . appar@@ ently they w@@ ri@@ gg@@ le around . they &apos;re kind of hard to gr@@ ab , these ma@@ gg@@ ots .
the future bu@@ dd@@ ha has come ahead of all predic@@ tions . here he is . &quot;
so , my mother in this life is really great . but all of you in a way are part of the et@@ ern@@ al mother .
but you think of him as a mom .
how boring to run around ch@@ as@@ ing you .
and so the next step -- the six@@ th step beyond &quot; universal compassion &quot; -- is this thing where you &apos;re linked with the needs of others in a true way , and you have compassion for yourself also , and it isn &apos;t senti@@ mental only . you might be in fear of something .
and take universal responsibility for them . and then , not only will god smile and the et@@ ern@@ al ma@@ ma will smile , but k@@ aren arm@@ strong will smile .
it &apos;s when the internet comb@@ ines with these kinds of passionate pro@@ -@@ am consum@@ ers -- who are knowle@@ d@@ ge@@ able ; they &apos;ve got the incenti@@ ve to innov@@ ate ; they &apos;ve got the tools ; they want to -- that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration .
so the more radical the innovation , the more the un@@ certa@@ int@@ y , the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for .
they work at their le@@ is@@ ure , if you like .
and so the deb@@ ates about copyright , digital rights , so on and so forth -- these are all about trying to sti@@ f@@ le , in my view , these kinds of organizations .
what &apos;s happening there is that the whole dom@@ ain of creativity is exp@@ anding .
how many people does he emplo@@ y to service that population ?
&lt; / transcript &gt;
but this project changed the way that i thought about connec@@ ting to people .
hundreds of re@@ mix@@ es came back -- lots of different attemp@@ ts .
when they smile -- right , you &apos;ve seen people stop -- all of a sudden , life is being lived there , somewhere up in that weird , dense network .
and people called in and left messages like this . recor@@ ding : okay , here &apos;s something .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m dr@@ essed as bat@@ man to hi@@ de my identity . &quot;
so i asked for people &apos;s us@@ er@@ names and pass@@ words to be sent to me .
and when you put them together , something magi@@ cal happens , something absolutely incredible happens , and all of a sudden i get a chor@@ us from around the world .
so we &apos;re interested in exactly where in the brain , and what &apos;s the most important part of the brain .
so it doesn &apos;t work later on in life .
she goes , &quot; no it gets worse , read this book . &quot;
brian co@@ x on cer@@ n &apos;s super@@ colli@@ der
and the aim of parti@@ cle physics is to understand what everything &apos;s made of , and how everything sti@@ cks together .
and these particles have been discovered over the last century , pretty much .
a bottle of champ@@ agne for anyone that tells me .
and imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent wal@@ ks into the room .
but actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to uni@@ fy together , back at the big bang --
and on some of those planets , the oxygen , which had been created in that first generation of stars , could fu@@ se with hydrogen to form water , liquid water on the surface .
art was part of the answer , and my name , in the very beginning , was linked with two things : demo@@ li@@ tion of il@@ legal constru@@ ctions in order to get public space back , and use of colors in order to re@@ vi@@ ve the hope that had been lost in my city .
thir@@ ty@@ -@@ seven said no , we don &apos;t like it .
they were paying in order to ski@@ p the queue , the long queue .
it is about how people think , how they view the world around them , how they use their time and their energy .
players who didn &apos;t smile in their pictures lived an average of only 7@@ 2.@@ 9 years , where players with be@@ aming s@@ miles lived an average of almost 80 years .
in a related ger@@ man study , researchers used f@@ m@@ ri imag@@ ing to measure brain activity before and after inj@@ ecting bot@@ o@@ x to sup@@ press sm@@ iling muscles .
government institutions were completely de@@ capit@@ ated , including the pres@@ identi@@ al pal@@ ace .
and we wanted it to be easy to use .
young people living in ki@@ ber@@ a in their community , with simple hand@@ held devices , g@@ ps hand@@ held devices and sm@@ s-@@ en@@ ab@@ led mobile phones , have literally put themselves on the map .
people are understanding , from c@@ air@@ o to o@@ ak@@ land , that there are new ways to come together , there are new ways to mobi@@ li@@ ze , there are new ways to influence .
but what i &apos;ve come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand mes@@ si@@ an@@ ic ges@@ tures , but in the simple accumul@@ ation of gent@@ le , soft , almost invisible acts of compassion , everyday acts of compassion .
why don &apos;t they use it ? &quot;
and they would sing them only when they plan@@ ted the rice , as though they were see@@ ding the hear@@ ts of the dead into the rice .
anyway , a go@@ at &apos;s eyes are like a child &apos;s eyes .
the name was john james , and in those days , if a family member commit@@ ted a crime , the military would hold you as ran@@ so@@ m ti@@ ll your family turned themselves in .
this is how they came to re@@ claim their humanity .
however , the vehic@@ les you see here are big .
so here r is the character@@ istic length of the robot .
so one of the problems with these small robots is their pay@@ load carrying capacity . so you might want to have multiple robots carry pay@@ lo@@ ads .
so another thing the robot can do is it rem@@ em@@ bers pieces of traj@@ ect@@ ory that it lear@@ ns or is pre-@@ program@@ med .
plus the robots have to base their actions only on local information , what they sense from their neighbors .
so all these experiments you &apos;ve seen th@@ us far , all these demonstr@@ ations , have been done with the help of motion capture systems .
i want to conclu@@ de with a music video .
here you can see some pictures of what are called green ro@@ o@@ fs , or urban agriculture .
we think , oh , bees , coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side , agriculture , but that &apos;s not what the bees are showing .
many of us will remember our childhood growing up , maybe you got stun@@ g by a be@@ e , you saw bees on f@@ lowers .
and then one day i said , &quot; why don &apos;t we just do an oral vaccine ? &quot; it &apos;s like , &quot; u@@ gh , &quot; so that &apos;s what we do .
what can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future ?
first of all , a little bit of audience participation .
it was only 200 years ago that we had the ad@@ vent of the industrial revolution .
what happened to our bread in the mean@@ time ?
how many of you can actually tell whe@@ at apart from other cer@@ e@@ als ?
if we say just small@@ -@@ scale production , as is the tend@@ ency here , to go back to local food means that a poor man like h@@ ans ros@@ ling cannot even eat or@@ ang@@ es anymore because in sc@@ and@@ in@@ av@@ ia we don &apos;t have or@@ ang@@ es .
but yes there are some solutions .
and i want to use the energy that comes from those green@@ houses and from the fer@@ mentation of cro@@ ps to heat our res@@ identi@@ al areas .
and never before have we had the lux@@ ury of taking it for gran@@ ted because it is now so cheap .
because that is the only way i &apos;m going to get my story across to you .
and it is a mar@@ vel@@ ous rain forest .
usually they eat something a bit larger .
you drink it in per@@ il of your life .
but then the mon@@ soon arri@@ ves , and unfortunately down@@ river there is always a dam or there is always a b@@ arr@@ age , and , sho@@ op , they get wash@@ ed down to their do@@ om .
it &apos;s a place that &apos;s famous to a lot of you who know about the band@@ its , the d@@ ac@@ o@@ its who used to work up there . and there still are quite a few around .
but if you str@@ ol@@ l down to the y@@ am@@ un@@ a or to the g@@ om@@ at@@ i in lu@@ c@@ know , or to the ad@@ y@@ ar river in ch@@ enn@@ ai , or the mu@@ la@@ -@@ mu@@ th@@ a river in p@@ une , just see what we &apos;re capable of doing to a river . it &apos;s sad .
but this guy who we &apos;re following right now is in the deep jun@@ gle .
for re@@ vers@@ ing disease , that ’ s what it takes , but if you ’ re just trying to be healthy , you have a spectrum of choices .
it ’ s important , but not enough .
so does coca@@ ine , so does a high fat diet , so does emotional stress .
and it ’ s the volume of food that aff@@ ects s@@ ati@@ ety , rather than the type of food .
you ’ ll lose even more weight if you go to whole fo@@ ods and less fat , and you ’ ll enh@@ ance your health rather than har@@ ming it .
so we took some of their blood ser@@ um and sent it down to u@@ c@@ la ; they added it to a standard line of pro@@ state tumor cells growing in tissue culture , and it in@@ hi@@ b@@ ited the growth seven times more in the experiment@@ al group than in the control group -- 70 versus 9 percent .
and at the end of it , somebody said , &quot; hey , sw@@ ami , what ’ s the difference between well@@ ness and ill@@ ness ? &quot;
girl : you &apos;re different than anybody i &apos;ve ever met .
he wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cr@@ ad@@ le to the grave by one actor .
you know , this is some tough stuff .
so we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything a human being can do .
and of course , these trans@@ c@@ end age , race , culture , g@@ ender .
and we also brought in a gentlem@@ an named k@@ az@@ u t@@ suj@@ i , and k@@ az@@ u t@@ suj@@ i is one of the great phot@@ ore@@ alist sculp@@ tors of our time .
but now we needed to get br@@ ad &apos;s performance to drive our virtual benjamin .
we found the old ad@@ age , you know , &quot; the eyes are the window to the sou@@ l , &quot; absolutely true .
but ... maybe not .
so , we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable man@@ ner .
education . the kids never went to school .
&#91; sh@@ it &#93; this is argu@@ ably the back end of the design of animals .
and eventually , our worst ni@@ ght@@ ma@@ re happened : they f@@ loo@@ ded the engine .
go underneath it . go above it . go around it .
so not only do they have the very long ey@@ el@@ ash@@ es , but there &apos;s the second@@ ary -- i guess you &apos;d call it the &#91; un@@ clear &#93; or whatever .
we &apos;re kind of like bu@@ ds , but i &apos;m also a male as well and he &apos;s -- kb : he sees you as competition ? sen@@ ior kee@@ per : yeah , exactly .
and we &apos;ve seen that repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly through this conference -- not just this year , but in past years .
i think more influ@@ enti@@ al than em@@ ily dic@@ kin@@ son or col@@ er@@ id@@ ge or wor@@ d@@ s@@ worth on my imagination were war@@ ner brothers , mer@@ rie mel@@ o@@ dies and lo@@ on@@ y tu@@ nes carto@@ ons .
and i think you could bo@@ il this po@@ em down to saying , &quot; some days you eat the bear , other days the bear e@@ ats you . &quot; and it uses the imag@@ ery of dol@@ l@@ house fur@@ n@@ iture .
and when i would go up to the country , he would teach me things like de@@ er hun@@ ting , which meant getting lost with a g@@ un basically -- and tr@@ out fishing and stuff like that .
it took a long time -- i mean , it &apos;s rather un@@ common to have this marriage -- a long time to put those two together .
der@@ ek si@@ vers : how to start a movement
but they will be part of the in-@@ crowd if they hur@@ ry .
so it had its down@@ sides .
this was no small fe@@ at , because if you listen to der@@ mat@@ o@@ logists , they say that you should have a shot glass full of sun@@ screen .
i was so focused on doing all these things that i was ne@@ gl@@ ecting my friends and family .
and by the way , it &apos;s also terrible for your brain .
i do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make .
or would i go on television to demonstr@@ ate , in front of a live audience , that comfort fo@@ ods really do make you feel better ?
the head@@ line ? &quot; you love your iphone . literally . &quot; it quickly became the most em@@ ailed article on the site .
we see it in super@@ markets , on book co@@ vers .
ra@@ j@@ esh ra@@ o is fascin@@ ated by &quot; the mother of all cross@@ word puzz@@ les &quot; : how to dec@@ i@@ ph@@ er the 4@@ 000 year old ind@@ us s@@ cript . at ted 20@@ 11 he tells how he is en@@ list@@ ing modern compu@@ t@@ ational techniques to read the ind@@ us language , the key piece to understanding this ancient civilization .
but who is this person ?
so you know those p@@ acking sli@@ ps you get on your fe@@ de@@ x boxes ?
so as i showed you , they &apos;re usually found on these se@@ als that are very , very tiny .
and so that &apos;s one of the first things we know , that direc@@ tion@@ ality is a very key aspect of lin@@ gu@@ istic scri@@ p@@ ts .
in the rest of the cases , typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer .
we found that the ind@@ us s@@ cript actually falls within the range of the lin@@ gu@@ istic scri@@ p@@ ts .
they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived ,
and i &apos;d like to give you a quick example of par@@ po@@ la &apos;s work .
what would they tell us ?
radio astronom@@ ers study radio waves from space using sensitive anten@@ n@@ as and rece@@ i@@ vers , which give them pre@@ cise information about what an astronom@@ ical object is and where it is in our night sky .
but going from sl@@ inging some wire across ro@@ of@@ top@@ s in boston to l@@ aying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the atlan@@ tic ocean se@@ ab@@ ed is no easy matter .
but the noise didn &apos;t dis@@ appear .
they actually see land@@ s@@ cap@@ es and human beings and go@@ ds and drag@@ ons and ser@@ p@@ ent beings and go@@ dd@@ esses and things like that .
who &apos;s not going to be over@@ run by an infin@@ ite number of other beings -- if you &apos;re different from all the other beings ?
and then it &apos;s never good enough .
so , compassion means to feel the feelings of others , and the human being actually is compassion .
temp@@ t was one of the fore@@ most gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i artists in the 8@@ 0s .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the fun@@ ni@@ est -- i call him yo@@ da , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m not wor@@ thy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot; the other thing we did is we fle@@ w seven program@@ mers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
i feel like i had been held under@@ water , and someone finally reach@@ ed down and pulled my head up so i could breathe . &quot; isn &apos;t that aw@@ es@@ ome ?
this is ki@@ m , a n@@ in@@ e-@@ year-old viet@@ nam girl , her back ru@@ ined by n@@ ap@@ al@@ m , and she aw@@ a@@ ken@@ ed the conscience of the nation of america to begin to end the viet@@ nam war .
they won public opinion over a long period of time .
am@@ y w@@ ine@@ house said , &quot; n@@ el@@ son mandel@@ a and i have a lot in common .
you cannot begin to build a health@@ care system for six million people with such limited resources .
so my argument today is basically this .
if we go to the dicti@@ onary , it says , &quot; it &apos;s the lower extrem@@ ity of a leg that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking &quot; that &apos;s the traditional definition .
you can do another experiment where you can take a cock@@ ro@@ ach with a foot , and you can re@@ move its foot .
can this help us inspire the design of nov@@ el robots ?
the cr@@ ab@@ s are missing sp@@ ines , so they have a problem in this kind of r@@ ough terrain .
we can actually model that behavior better as a flu@@ id , if you look at it .
you see what happens ?
the g@@ ec@@ ko has a billion of these 200@@ -@@ nan@@ om@@ et@@ er-@@ si@@ zed sp@@ lit ends .
and here are rise &apos;s first steps on an in@@ cl@@ ine .
don &apos;t put it all in the brain , but put some of the control in tu@@ ned feet , legs and even body .
the first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these under@@ water animals , whose world was so foreign to me , was evidence from cap@@ tive dol@@ ph@@ ins that cap@@ tive dol@@ ph@@ ins could im@@ it@@ ate human sounds .
what this figure shows is the percentage of the separ@@ ations in which dol@@ ph@@ ins wh@@ is@@ tle , against the maximum distance .
so it could have a negative impact on the whole population .
what happened was , during the cold war , the u.s. nav@@ y had a system that was secret at the time , that they used to track russi@@ an sub@@ mar@@ ines .
you can hear the full frequ@@ ency range . it &apos;s quite lou@@ d .
that in this frequ@@ ency range where wh@@ ales communicate , the main source glob@@ ally , on our planet , for the noise comes from human ships , thousands of human ships , dis@@ tant , far away , just all ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ating .
it &apos;s an amazing shift , in@@ duced by humans over this large scale , in both time and space .
well , biolog@@ ists who couldn &apos;t take no for an answer went to the international mari@@ time organization and peti@@ tion@@ ed them to say , &quot; can &apos;t you move that l@@ ane ? those are just lines on the ground .
&lt; transcript &gt;
second : you can tour the universe with astronom@@ ers as your gu@@ ides . and i &apos;m not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you &apos;re seeing , but really people who are passionate about the various no@@ o@@ ks and cr@@ anni@@ es of the universe , who can share their en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m and can make the universe a wel@@ coming place . and third , you can create your own tours -- you can share them with friends , you can create them with friends -- and that &apos;s the part that i think i &apos;m most excited about because i think that at heart , we are all story@@ t@@ ell@@ ers . and in telling stories , each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way .
&lt; transcript &gt;
there &apos;s something i &apos;m developing here called social inten@@ sity syndrome , which tries to account for why guys really pre@@ fer male bon@@ ding over female mat@@ ing .
i &apos;m here to al@@ arm . it &apos;s your job to solve .
google should have something like this in their lo@@ bby .
je@@ ff h@@ an : i &apos;m a research scientist at n@@ y@@ u in new york .
and then what i can do is manipul@@ ate them with both of my fingers at the same time .
it will also make members of crimin@@ al organizations nervous for the same reasons .
even of sal@@ in@@ as .
and we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
there are examples of this kind of action in mexico .
i think anyone who has ste@@ pped foot on this land -- not to mention all mex@@ i@@ can people -- will agree that it &apos;s not difficult to love mexico .
anyone can kill me , or you , or you .
i do a big piece in a tri@@ angle and these are three sec@@ tions from it .
and then you get crazy .
ok , so since you all don &apos;t understand what the fi@@ ve-@@ ball pattern is , i &apos;m going to give you a little clu@@ e .
now , one more time , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
trying to figure that stuff out . but is it going to get you anywhere ?
because i use ram@@ ps of different par@@ ab@@ ol@@ as that i roll the ball@@ s on while i &apos;m keeping time with this .
so , i &apos;ll come back to that in a second . but working with one ball , now , what if you att@@ ach something to it , or change it .
and what it invol@@ ves , and i don &apos;t know if my hands are too be@@ aten up to do it or not , but i &apos;ll do a little bit of it .
and if you were here last year , i probably w@@ rest@@ led you to the floor and tried to show you my new ey@@ emo@@ du@@ le 2 , which was a camera that plu@@ gg@@ ed into the hand@@ spring .
you pick them up , and once you see something that you &apos;re interested in , the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store .
the next video is not done by us .
the pav@@ ili@@ on &apos;s design goal was to be kind of quiet and pe@@ ac@@ eful .
the flu@@ id graph@@ ics and ambi@@ ent sounds combine to help you completely lose yourself under@@ water . ) d@@ k : and the last thing i &apos;ll talk about is ap@@ prot@@ ec , which is a project that i &apos;m very excited about .
&lt; transcript &gt;
after her name , written in br@@ ack@@ ets was the ap@@ t description , horse face .
so that &apos;s why we don &apos;t think it exists , the su@@ fi ma@@ sters working on us .
time , nobody can see time .
gas , you can &apos;t see that .
and he said , &quot; well , i &apos;ve no idea .
so we assembl@@ ed a team of experts , sp@@ ann@@ ing harvard , mit , the american her@@ itage dicti@@ onary , the encyclo@@ pedia brit@@ ann@@ ic@@ a and even our proud spon@@ s@@ ors , the google .
since then , the auth@@ ors have won on 1@@ 29 million dist@@ inct occa@@ sions , publi@@ sh@@ ing books .
let &apos;s suppose that i am th@@ ri@@ ving , then tomorrow i want to tell you about how well i did .
in fact , 19@@ 50 was so fascinating that for years ther@@ ea@@ f@@ ter , people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened , in &apos; 5@@ 1 , &apos; 5@@ 2 , &apos; 5@@ 3 .
now these signals are actually so strong that we don &apos;t need to know that someone was cen@@ so@@ red .
we have to make this available for people . &quot; so in two weeks flat -- the two weeks before our paper came out -- they co@@ ded up a version of the n@@ gram vie@@ wer for the general public .
these all happen to be on our computers , on computers across the world .
sound places us in space and in time .
this is not tri@@ vi@@ al .
it &apos;s around us all the time .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
it was one of the best issues ever . and they talked about the neur@@ on and development and disease and vision and all the things you might want to know about brains . it was really quite impres@@ sive .
that &apos;s when i designed all those computer products .
this works in physics . this works in ge@@ ology . but if this is normal science , what does neuro@@ science look like ? this is what neuro@@ science looks like .
it &apos;s not as complex as it looks . that &apos;s not the issue .
and now it &apos;s not that hard , you know , here &apos;s the apple , here &apos;s the orange , you know , the earth goes around , that kind of stuff .
a behavi@@ oral me@@ tric of what intelligence is , and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time .
ne@@ o@@ cortex means new layer . it is a new layer on top of your brain .
so we are now able to make very sophisticated motor planning , things like that .
and that &apos;s because you &apos;re making a pre@@ diction .
not like computer memory . it &apos;s not at all like computer memory .
we can also do intelligent security systems .
it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dig@@ nifi@@ ed lives , where these people have enough access to education and health care , so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear .
i was in hi@@ ro@@ sh@@ im@@ a a couple of weeks ago , and his hol@@ iness -- we &apos;re sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city , and there were about eight of us nobel lau@@ re@@ ates .
and instead of going home , she con@@ fer@@ red with all the other women that she works with , who said to her , &quot; stay out . we need you out .
she is now running for president .
throughout her life she had been he@@ ating water with fi@@ re@@ wood , and she had hand wash@@ ed laun@@ dry for seven children .
and the re@@ main@@ ing five billion , how do they was@@ h ?
and these ones who have wash@@ ing machines , but not a house full of other machines , they use two .
it &apos;s a real challenge in the future .
&lt; transcript &gt;
we had a financial regul@@ atory regi@@ me based on the assu@@ mp@@ tions that tr@@ ad@@ ers were rational creatures who wouldn &apos;t do anything stupid .
it would be a big sel@@ ler .
and this leads to od@@ di@@ ties .
when we watch a car cha@@ se in a movie , it &apos;s almost as if we are sub@@ tly having a car cha@@ se .
they have trouble rel@@ ating to other people .
and the effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess of a group is not deter@@ min@@ ed by the i@@ q of the group ; it &apos;s deter@@ min@@ ed by how well they communicate , how often they take turns in conversation .
through the policy failu@@ res of the last 30 years , we have come to ac@@ knowledge , i think , how sh@@ allow our view of human nature has been .
but what people really often think about the dicti@@ onary is , they think more like this .
computers ! what about computers ?
so -- -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham but@@ t problem .
you know , there &apos;re still going to be paper dicti@@ on@@ aries , but it &apos;s not going to be the domin@@ ant dicti@@ onary .
but if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic , but maybe to count the cars that go by , then more ey@@ e@@ ball@@ s are better .
and we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
and words and en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m actually happen to be the reci@@ pe for l@@ ex@@ ic@@ ograp@@ hy . isn &apos;t that great ?
it wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
they are sold in the name of forced labor , cam@@ el j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying , anything , everything .
these are men who buy you for an hour , for a day , and use you , throw you .
you see a girl here who is trained as a wel@@ der .
it &apos;s very nice for discussion , dis@@ course , making films and everything .
i &apos;m asking you this because no child , no human being , des@@ er@@ ves what these children have gone through .
fe@@ bru@@ ary 2001 -- in one day we l@@ aid off 3@@ 50 people , and before the b@@ loo@@ d@@ shed was finished , 1,000 people had lost their jobs from my companies . i felt sick .
but something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mos@@ que or syn@@ ag@@ o@@ gue , today it turns out that there &apos;s do@@ z@@ ens of te@@ d-@@ like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting .
truth , curios@@ ity , diversity , no selling , no corpor@@ ate bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it , no band@@ w@@ ag@@ oning , no plat@@ forms .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and at the sli@@ gh@@ test sound , they hi@@ de back again .
so@@ ren ent@@ ers the room . pop ! he goes invisible .
so i &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scen@@ ario -- it &apos;s much faster .
so those who are &quot; yes , &quot; raise your hand . &quot; for . &quot;
electricity for cities , at its best , is what &apos;s called bas@@ el@@ o@@ ad electricity .
solar &apos;s wonderful on ro@@ of@@ top@@ s .
so argu@@ ing against , a man who &apos;s been at the n@@ it@@ ty , gr@@ it@@ ty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years .
so the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind , or something else .
as you can see from these pictures , the spac@@ ing between can be used for multiple pur@@ pos@@ es including agri@@ cultural land , range land or open space .
you can either have wind or nuclear .
you can make it reli@@ able , as i showed with that diag@@ ram .
tell me that those accidents aren &apos;t going to put material into the environment that is pois@@ on@@ ous for hundreds of thousands of years .
ray k@@ ur@@ z@@ we@@ il and all the other talks -- we know that the stick is going up exponenti@@ ally .
there &apos;s pl@@ enty of resource . you can make it reli@@ able .
in fact , the earth is a cru@@ m@@ b in a super@@ market filled with resources .
they had to make up everything . and that , my friend , is amazing motivation .
if you calcul@@ ate the amount of potential energy , m@@ gh , to take you and your spac@@ es@@ u@@ it up to a couple hundred miles , and then you acceler@@ ate yourself to 17@@ ,@@ 500 miles per hour --
pil@@ ot : release our fire .
people think a zero gravity room , there &apos;s a switch on there that turns it off -- but it &apos;s actually par@@ abo@@ lic flight of an airplane .
if you were going to go and try to create spac@@ es@@ hi@@ po@@ ne , or any kind of a new technology , you have to fund that from the beginning and maint@@ ain that fun@@ ding with an un@@ certain out@@ come .
&lt; transcript &gt;
a simple volume , the cu@@ be .
we can plo@@ t the plan@@ ar@@ ity of the surfaces , their cur@@ v@@ ature , how radi@@ al they are -- all information that may not be inst@@ antly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can arti@@ cul@@ ate , and that we can use to control the fol@@ ding .
there &apos;s too many surfaces , there &apos;s too much detail , one can &apos;t see the end state .
machines are getting faster , it &apos;s getting less expensive , and there &apos;s some promis@@ ing technological develop@@ ments just on the horizon .
what made me do this work ? i shall go into my story .
and i thought , &quot; these ants , are they looking for the queen ant ?
and i &apos;ll explain .
because that has happened to me .
which i held and stre@@ t@@ ched .
whenever you work on that level , things be@@ have different .
and wh@@ il@@ st i &apos;m painting i have to be very car@@ eful ,
and she saw me walking around like this .
well , i can look at this one and i can be very proud of this ,
and that &apos;s 2@@ 4@@ -@@ kar@@ at gold . and it &apos;s construc@@ ted . i built it .
her answer was quite the contr@@ ary .
in a time where the world is becoming person@@ alized , when the mobile phone , the bur@@ ger , the tele@@ phone , everything has its own personal identity , how should we perce@@ ive ourselves
in few hours , shir@@ in nes@@ h@@ at , my friend from iran who &apos;s a very important artist for us will be talking to you .
today i am proud to say we have trained and educ@@ ated over 6@@ 6 q@@ at@@ ar@@ i women fil@@ m@@ makers to e@@ dit , tell their own stories in their own voices .
&quot; know th@@ y@@ self , &quot; that is the journey of self-@@ expression and self-@@ realiz@@ ation that we are traveling .
how can we go to a greater bat@@ tle ? &quot;
that is a moment which is a gi@@ ft of god to us -- a gi@@ ft when , for a moment , he lif@@ ts that boun@@ d@@ ary which makes us ins@@ ist on &quot; i , i , i , me , me , me , &quot; and instead , like the person in ru@@ mi &apos;s story , we say , &quot; oh , this is all you .
the ang@@ els pro@@ str@@ ate , not before the human body , but before the human sou@@ l .
my mang@@ led body fle@@ w in one direction , my mang@@ led bi@@ ke fle@@ w in the other .
when they were born at 6 : 14 and 6 : 4@@ 6 on apr@@ il 15 , 2005 , our otherwise gri@@ m , hu@@ mor@@ less doctor looked at his watch , and was like , &quot; h@@ mm , apr@@ il 15@@ th -- ta@@ x day .
and it &apos;s appar@@ ently okay to mar@@ ry a boy from ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a , but not to have hair from texas .
and i s@@ nu@@ ck out behind ,
and as he talked he had that gl@@ int in his eye that i first saw back in hol@@ land -- the gl@@ int that says , &quot; let &apos;s go cow ti@@ pping , &quot; even though we never did ti@@ p the cow , even though no one ti@@ ps the cow , even though co@@ ws don &apos;t sleep standing up .
and one night i got a call from my mo@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law that my dau@@ gh@@ ters , at that time three and a half , were missing me and feeling my absence .
in fact , if i cl@@ ing to one memory of this year , it would be walking down a dar@@ ken@@ ed h@@ all@@ way with five spon@@ g@@ y fingers gr@@ as@@ ping the hand@@ le underneath my hand .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t see the wall , &quot; and i &apos;m telling you the same , don &apos;t see the wall .
beh@@ old the world in pause .
i got good news that day , and i stand here today can@@ cer@@ -@@ free , walking without aid and ho@@ b@@ bling forward .
and this man , he has been outside , but he &apos;s gone back , and he was saying , &quot; you know , we have suddenly ju@@ mped into a whole new era , and we didn &apos;t even know about the white man 50 years ago , and now here we are with laptop computers , and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world .
especially when chimpanz@@ ees , and other animals with large brains , are studied in cap@@ tivity ,
anyway , david gre@@ y@@ be@@ ard -- and i saw that he was pic@@ king little pieces of gr@@ ass and using them to fish ter@@ m@@ ites from their under@@ ground n@@ est .
we find that they show emotions , similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness , sad@@ ness , fear , des@@ pair .
we see de@@ for@@ estation ; we see the desert sp@@ reading ; we see massive hun@@ ger ; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support ,
and the more i talked about the chimpanz@@ ees &apos; pli@@ ght , the more i realized the fact that everything &apos;s inter@@ connected ,
so , the roots and sho@@ ots program invol@@ ves you@@ th in three kinds of projects .
and then , lo and beh@@ old , there &apos;s another group ans@@ wer@@ ing these kids who may be in america , or maybe this is a group in israel , saying , &quot; yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . this is how you should do it . &quot;
fir@@ stly , the human brain -- i don &apos;t need to say anything about that .
thank you .
in the labor@@ atory what we want to do is much the same , but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a dr@@ as@@ tic redu@@ ction in complexity , but still trying to produce something that looks lif@@ eli@@ ke .
so we &apos;re on a road towards living systems .
on the other hand we have two moving proto@@ cells that like to circle each other , and they form a kind of a dance , a complex dance with each other .
so this is similar to what happens when you take pure sugar cr@@ y@@ st@@ als in your kitchen , you put them in a p@@ an , and you apply energy .
without the sun , there &apos;s likely to be no life on this planet .
this is not the ger@@ ms that medi@@ co@@ s were trained to deal with ; this is a different definition of health , health that has a great advantage because it &apos;s ex@@ tern@@ al , it &apos;s shared , we can do something about it , as op@@ posed to intern@@ al , gene@@ tically pre@@ deter@@ min@@ ed or individu@@ alized .
they &apos;re even better models of environmental health , because not only the same mam@@ mal@@ ian biology , but they share your diet , larg@@ ely .
and that ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ating effect , that collective action effect , is actually something we can use to our advantage .
and they still rem@@ ain as ic@@ ons of civi@@ c response in the face of shared , un@@ certain , collective threat .
in fact , urban migr@@ ation now descri@@ bes the movement of animals for@@ mer@@ ly known as wild into urban centers .
the final project i &apos;d like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched -- it &apos;s actually offici@@ ally launched next week -- with a wonderful commis@@ sion from the architec@@ tural le@@ ague .
but in that action , that interaction , by re-@@ scri@@ p@@ ting that , by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutri@@ tion@@ ally appropriate , that could aug@@ ment the nutri@@ tional resources that we ourselves have de@@ pl@@ et@@ ed for augment@@ ing the fish population and also ad@@ ding ch@@ el@@ ating agent , which , like any ch@@ el@@ ating agent that we use medi@@ cin@@ ally , bin@@ ds to the bio@@ accumul@@ ated heavy met@@ als and p@@ c@@ bs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a har@@ m@@ less sal@@ t where it &apos;s complex@@ ed by a re@@ active , effectively re@@ moving it from bio@@ avail@@ ability .
we really have to ask the question : can the world sust@@ ain that number of automobi@@ les ?
it &apos;s produced in the ferti@@ liz@@ er industry ; it &apos;s produced in the chemical manufactu@@ ring industry .
we find that pre@@ mise quite exciting .
the substance of things un@@ seen .
i started seeing paint@@ ings like this .
or the sw@@ amp at gram@@ er@@ cy park , right here .
and we might think of these as aban@@ don@@ ed .
mo@@ re@@ over , we realized that you can start out as being a be@@ av@@ er speci@@ alist , but you can look up what an asp@@ en needs .
and we used it to try and re@@ v@@ eal a landscape here in act i@@ ii .
but i wouldn &apos;t have you think that i don &apos;t like the place on the right , which i quite do . i &apos;ve come to love the city and its kind of diversity , and its res@@ ili@@ ence , and its depend@@ ence on den@@ sity and how we &apos;re connected together .
you know , about a million years ago , a bunch of mon@@ keys fell out of trees , got a little cl@@ ever , har@@ n@@ essed fire , invented the print@@ ing press , made , you know , lu@@ gg@@ age with whe@@ els on it .
they &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to this idea of our society , of our pros@@ per@@ ity . and they may not want to live exactly like us .
if we can change the dynamic , by first of all creating cities that are den@@ ser and more li@@ v@@ able ...
we could just re-@@ lab@@ el things .
well , the first thing we need is , we need le@@ ap@@ fro@@ gg@@ ing .
so it &apos;s not , you know , bol@@ lywood isn &apos;t just ans@@ wer@@ ing hollywood . right ?
i would keep your eye on this fellow .
here &apos;s a design for harv@@ es@@ ting rain@@ water that &apos;s super cheap and available to people in the developing world .
and as they grow up , they will grow up around the mines , their roots will det@@ ect the chemicals in them , and where the f@@ lowers turn red you don &apos;t step .
and poli@@ cing copyright viol@@ ations for children &apos;s birth@@ day ca@@ kes was such a h@@ ass@@ le that the college ba@@ k@@ ery said , &quot; you know what , we &apos;re getting out of that business .
because it turned out we &apos;re not really cou@@ ch pot@@ ato@@ es .
so in order to fa@@ ke the ability to sell un@@ copy@@ able bits , the d@@ m@@ ca also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the cop@@ ying function of your devices .
imagine this sign everywhere -- except imagine it doesn &apos;t say college ba@@ k@@ ery , imagine it says youtube and facebook and twitter .
they just want the sharing to go away .
it changed my life .
&quot; what are you doing here ?
so the college works following the lifes@@ ty@@ le and work@@ style of ma@@ hat@@ ma gand@@ hi .
i asked a for@@ es@@ ter -- high-@@ powered , pap@@ er-@@ quali@@ fied expert -- i said , &quot; what can you build in this place ? &quot;
it &apos;s a par@@ abo@@ lic sch@@ eff@@ ler solar co@@ ok@@ er .
she has a ca@@ bin@@ et , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health .
men are rest@@ less , men are ambi@@ ti@@ ous , men are com@@ pul@@ si@@ vely mobile , and they all want a certi@@ fic@@ ate .
and they haven &apos;t collap@@ sed .
i knew which woman i would like to take .
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
and it &apos;s our attempt to quanti@@ fy beauty by finding which regi@@ ons of the brain are interactive while wit@@ n@@ essing something beautiful .
so they &apos;re singing to you .
dan g@@ il@@ bert , auth@@ or of stu@@ m@@ bling on happiness , challenges the idea that we ’ ll be mis@@ er@@ able if we don ’ t get what we want . our &quot; psycho@@ logical imm@@ une system &quot; lets us feel truly happy even when things don ’ t go as plann@@ ed .
interes@@ t@@ ingly , there are data on these two groups of people , data on how happy they are .
and here are three guys syn@@ thes@@ izing happiness . &quot; i am so much better off physi@@ cally , financi@@ ally , emo@@ tion@@ ally , ment@@ ally and almost every other way . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have one minute &apos;s regret . it was a g@@ lor@@ i@@ ous experience . &quot; &quot; i believe it turned out for the best . &quot; who are these characters who are so dam@@ n happy ?
what are these terms ?
i &apos;ll take number three . &quot; we explained we would have number three m@@ ailed to them .
you find a way to be happy with what &apos;s happened .
hel@@ lo ? 6@@ 6 percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dis@@ satis@@ fied with the picture .
&quot; hey , ma , i got to talk to you . &quot;
great story is the art of l@@ etting go .
and i was calling about how to make a@@ ji@@ ac@@ o . it &apos;s a cu@@ ban m@@ eal .
and this is the woman that wants me to come on a satur@@ day morning when i have a lot to do , but it doesn &apos;t take long because cu@@ ban gu@@ il@@ t is a we@@ igh@@ ty thing .
&quot; oh , my god . &quot; i said , &quot; ok , fine . does pop know you &apos;re driving ? &quot;
&quot; yeah . and you haven &apos;t been stopped ? &quot;
but that doesn &apos;t happen most of the time , right ?
&quot; look , the chev@@ y -- he &apos;s coming this way . &quot;
you know , she e@@ ats small por@@ tions .
i finally come -- and now , it &apos;s the south .
now , some of them you &apos;ve got to make up , people .
it &apos;s a hal@@ f-@@ wh@@ is@@ per , &quot; god , i miss her . &quot;
we have a rock@@ et@@ m@@ av@@ eric@@ k@@ s@@ .com website with my photos if you want to learn more about this , particip@@ ate , be a spec@@ t@@ ator .
and in many ways , i try to capture the mis@@ hap@@ s ; it &apos;s the challenge in photograph@@ y when these things all take place in a fraction of a second .
what zi@@ p@@ car does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas
it requi@@ red that it was completely tri@@ vi@@ al : that it takes 30 seconds to res@@ erve a car , go get it , drive it .
and that &apos;s pers@@ is@@ ted for the four years in which they &apos;ve been doing con@@ gestion pr@@ ic@@ ing .
and this is a moment from &quot; the graduate . &quot; do you remember this moment ?
they &apos;re res@@ ili@@ ent ; their red@@ un@@ d@@ ancy is built into this fabul@@ ous dec@@ entr@@ alized design .
we have this incredible exc@@ ess capacity .
and they got here in the late 196@@ 0s .
i was going through a lot of personal problems at the time .
i was like , that sounds totally fa@@ ke .
the second &quot; a &quot; is awar@@ eness .
in his deeply authenti@@ c self , he also loved need@@ le@@ point .
so i wanted to ask them to , if they don &apos;t mind , stand up .
and when we did , my dad would say , &quot; can you believe someone clim@@ bed a tree over there , picked this thing off it , put it in a tru@@ ck , dro@@ ve it all the way to the do@@ cks and then s@@ ailed it all the way across the atlan@@ tic ocean and then put it in another tru@@ ck and dro@@ ve that all the way to a tiny gro@@ cer@@ y store just outside our house , so they could sell it to us for 25 cents ? &quot;
thank you .
unlike the grand cany@@ on or the washington mon@@ u@@ ment , people come here to see what &apos;s no longer there .
ka : were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about ful@@ f@@ illing wants -- suddenly ful@@ f@@ illing needs ?
so ri@@ ck and li@@ z and kevin and i came up with the idea .
but this was a half a million dollar project ?
ka : sort of like the sp@@ in@@ al ta@@ p scene where you get the tiny little st@@ on@@ e@@ hen@@ ge , i guess ?
dr : well here &apos;s the issue :
and a day or two before it opened was gi@@ u@@ li@@ an@@ i &apos;s f@@ are@@ well address , where he pro@@ posed the idea of all of ground zero being a mem@@ ori@@ al .
so yeah , i think there is a chance to re-@@ look at how we think about cities .
it &apos;s 3@@ 50 people on the commit@@ te@@ e for ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a city , which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad@@ -@@ ho@@ c , spontan@@ e@@ ous solution that exp@@ and@@ ed on union square and the places that were ad@@ -@@ ho@@ c mem@@ ori@@ als in the city already .
and then , finally , all su@@ ited up for the 9@@ 0-@@ minute drive to cop@@ per mountain .
how do we know that leg@@ is@@ lation that would require that they be pulled from play , clear@@ ed for return to play , appli@@ es to them ?
if only .
maybe offer to spe@@ ar@@ head a fun@@ d@@ rais@@ er to buy new g@@ ear --
in the 19@@ th century , it was a corru@@ pt politici@@ an .
here &apos;s another interesting truth about the do@@ od@@ le : people who do@@ od@@ le when they &apos;re ex@@ posed to ver@@ bal information re@@ tain more of that information than their non-@@ do@@ od@@ ling counter@@ parts .
wol@@ f@@ gang k@@ ess@@ ling : how to air@@ -@@ condition out@@ door spaces
so if i over@@ lay , and if you over@@ lay all these comfort envelop@@ es , what we see is , in all these places , air temperature has been rang@@ ing something from 25 to 35 , and if you go on the line , 30 , of 30 degrees c ambi@@ ent temper@@ atures . if you go along that line you see there has been all kind of comfort , all kinds of perce@@ ived out@@ door comfort , rang@@ ing from very comfortable to very un@@ comfortable .
they can ad@@ just and find their comfort they need to find .
shu@@ k@@ ran .
and so i suddenly realized two very simple things :
how much clu@@ st@@ ering is there ?
another more sub@@ tle possibility is that they start g@@ aining weight , and it changes your ideas of what an accep@@ table body size is .
now , when looked at this , it changed the way i see things , because this thing , this network that &apos;s changing across time , it has a memory , it moves , things flow within it , it has a kind of cons@@ is@@ ten@@ cy -- people can die , but it doesn &apos;t die ; it still pers@@ ists --
maybe , in fact , emotions have a collective existence , not just an individual existence .
now , those people both have four friends , but a &apos;s friends all know each other , and b &apos;s friends do not .
how does this help us understand ?
simil@@ arly , social networks are requi@@ red for the spread of good and valuable things , like love and kin@@ dness and happiness and al@@ tru@@ ism and ideas .
they &apos;re here , getting better and better every day .
it &apos;s not really a conscious decision ,
because , if you haven &apos;t noticed from my skin color , i &apos;m white , and that is a huge barri@@ er on a n@@ ative reser@@ vation .
i want to repe@@ at that part .
sign the paper , or no food for your tri@@ be .
with this event , a new era in n@@ ative american history began .
the tu@@ ber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis rate on p@@ ine ri@@ dge is appro@@ xim@@ ately eight times higher than the u.s. national average .
because the solution seems so far in the past , i needed nothing short of a time machine to access them .
they lack nutri@@ ents , and di@@ arr@@ he@@ a de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ates them .
and this what i want to think of as the dis@@ concer@@ ting thing , what i want to call &quot; the last mile &quot; problem .
it &apos;s not just medicine .
now , di@@ arr@@ he@@ a &apos;s interesting because it &apos;s been around for thousands of years , ever since human@@ kind really lived side by side enough to have really pollu@@ ted water .
it &apos;s more complex than that .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do : i &apos;m going to put objects on the screen .
i &apos;ll give you a good example of how it actually effects persu@@ a@@ sion .
if we want to encourage change of behavior , g@@ allons per mile would have far more effec@@ ti@@ ven@@ ess .
this is a typical in@@ su@@ lin inj@@ ection .
and you want to think about the social value of that in terms of carbon off@@ sets , re@@ duced electricity , 9@@ 00 million dollars per year .
i mean , it sometimes feels , listening to behavi@@ oral econom@@ ists that they are kind of putting into place academ@@ ically , what great mark@@ eters have sort of intu@@ i@@ tively known for a long time .
these are infl@@ at@@ able mon@@ keys in every city in scot@@ land : &quot; everybody always thinks they are right . &quot; they were combin@@ ed in the media .
if it &apos;s -- see it for a long enough time , i actually do something about it .
and this is nothing new .
and we can start talking about things like electrical load .
do you agree ?
good . nice . and you can sit over there .
so i think , number three , i have arrang@@ ed them in a full house . with que@@ ens and -- it &apos;s ok --
here , i can esti@@ mate exactly how many cards are put between my roy@@ al fl@@ ush .
direct in the right brain , that &apos;s much better . and so -- -- ar@@ thu@@ r benjamin did a little of the same thing .
just push them through , good . thank you .
ok . another person . oh , i for@@ got , i shouldn &apos;t shu@@ ff@@ le but i think -- -- actually , my technique is to pe@@ ek , all the time .
and you &apos;ll say stop , anywhere . got it ?
the fal@@ se count -- and the number one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight -- you say the same card all the time .
yeah , good .
there was the place . and here is king of s@@ pa@@ des , correct ?
i think we have it now . yeah , good , good .
and it was ok . one more ?
yeah , good .
yeah , i do this . i know where it is , because i pe@@ e@@ ked before and then i do this .
touch me , feel -- ah , ah , you know !
what actually happened was the impul@@ ses were re@@ duced .
and you have c@@ ds in your car , and you go to the sym@@ phon@@ y .
you have a fantastic ear . everybody has a fantastic ear . so nobody is ton@@ e-@@ dea@@ f .
so we have b , a , g , f@@ . and if we have b , a , g , f , what do we expect next ? oh , that might have been a flu@@ ke .
so this is a piece which goes from away to home .
and one of them came to me the next morning and he said , &quot; you know , i &apos;ve never list@@ ened to classi@@ cal music in my life , but when you played that sh@@ op@@ ping piece ... &quot;
that &apos;s a totally different world .
now , in america law is a professional degree : you get your university degree , then you go on to law school .
and eventually , after five or 10 minutes , most people figure out the solution , which you can see here .
and it does just the opposite .
i@@ f-@@ then re@@ wards work really well for those sorts of tas@@ ks , where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destin@@ ation to go to .
this is not a philosophy .
no . these are econom@@ ists from mit , from car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on , from the university of chicago .
in the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management .
why ? because you have to deliver something over@@ night .
and i say , &quot; no@@ pe . i have pro@@ of . &quot;
and here &apos;s the best part . here &apos;s the best part . we already know this . the science confir@@ ms what we know in our hear@@ ts .
except there is a s@@ light te@@ ther here , which keeps it from going over the top of its field .
and it &apos;s flo@@ ating . and this is in france .
this is a clock i designed .
so it can see its environment , and then it can mim@@ ic its environment and dis@@ appear .
okay . thank you .
now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
and as we &apos;re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not scar@@ y .
they are all , you know , warming up and doing stuff .
in tel avi@@ v they come to my concer@@ ts . &quot;
let &apos;s see somebody else , a great conduct@@ or . ri@@ c@@ car@@ do mu@@ ti , please .
three years ago he got a letter sig@@ ned by all 700 employees of la scal@@ a , musical employees , i mean the musici@@ ans , saying , &quot; you &apos;re a great conduct@@ or . we don &apos;t want to work with you . please res@@ ign . &quot;
did you see this kind of movement ? let me condu@@ ct you . twice .
oh yeah . he says , &quot; you start when you can &apos;t stand it anymore . &quot;
and you become a partner building the ro@@ ll@@ er@@ co@@ aster ,
now something else .
you know why ? because the meaning of the music is pain .
my work , for a long time , has been involved in education , in teaching people practical skills for sustain@@ ability ,
but of those , 65 have already passed their peak .
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually f@@ ea@@ sible .
the idea of res@@ ili@@ ence comes from the study of eco@@ logy .
some of the things that emer@@ ge from it are local food projects , like commun@@ it@@ y-@@ sup@@ ported agriculture s@@ chem@@ es , urban food production , creating local food direc@@ tor@@ ies , and so on . a lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies , commun@@ it@@ y-@@ ow@@ ned energy companies , where the community can invest money into itself , to start putting in place the kind of ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy infrastructure that we need .
because i think stories are v@@ ital here .
now out of that pie , the government sp@@ ends 3@@ 6 percent .
now he &apos;s put together some thoughts : about half of that he &apos;ll cut , another half , perhaps in a very complex set of steps , tax@@ es will be appro@@ ved .
the fore@@ cast for the medical piece alone is to go from 26 percent of the budget to 4@@ 2 percent .
it &apos;s sort of the vot@@ ers . it &apos;s sort of us showing up .
so we need these pieces .
this is the theme of my talk today .
when you have a conversation like this , the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started .
in other words , it &apos;s us@@ eless .
they don &apos;t draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to ear@@ n money for the family .
but such a teacher is sel@@ dom found .
we want to express , to re@@ v@@ eal ourselves , but with the artist dead , the arti@@ stic desire reve@@ als itself in dark form .
right now , we need to start our own art .
the really good writing i &apos;ve seen in my class was not from the as@@ sign@@ ments with a long dea@@ d@@ line , but from the 4@@ 0@@ - to 6@@ 0-@@ minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pen@@ cil .
so i asked the driver , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
they had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and v@@ ine@@ gars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and veget@@ ables and more than two do@@ zen different kinds of bot@@ tled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink ta@@ p water .
so in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that rang@@ ed from off@@ ering people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fund off@@ er@@ ings .
but the n@@ int@@ h largest re@@ tail@@ er , the n@@ int@@ h biggest re@@ tail@@ er in the world today is al@@ di , and it off@@ ers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of c@@ ann@@ ed tom@@ a@@ to sauce .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
who are they actually supposed to be in@@ forming ?
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be engag@@ ed .
its changes will affect all of humanity .
over the next few years i was dra@@ wn more and more into trying to communicate the ur@@ gency of a change in energy polici@@ es , while still resear@@ ching the physics of climate change .
yet , there was more energy coming in than going out .
where you are sitting now would be under water .
this fe@@ e and divi@@ d@@ end would stimul@@ ate the economy and innovations , creating millions of jobs .
at his day job , steve tru@@ gli@@ a fli@@ ps cars , wal@@ ks through fire and falls out of buildings -- push@@ ing technology to make stun@@ ts bigger , saf@@ er , more aw@@ es@@ ome . he talks us through his next stun@@ t : the highest jump ever attemp@@ ted , from the very edge of space .
he worked with john w@@ ay@@ ne and most of those old pun@@ ch@@ -@@ u@@ ps you see in the wes@@ ter@@ ns . y@@ ak@@ im@@ a was either there or he stun@@ t coordin@@ ated .
not today .
you should hear some of the phone conversations that i have with people on my blu@@ et@@ o@@ oth in the shop .
not the car@@ d@@ board box , but the green screen .
there were three ju@@ mps .
this is him in his old rock@@ -@@ and-@@ roll je@@ ans there , push@@ ing him in , those turned up je@@ ans .
that &apos;s in new mexico .
your blood tries to bo@@ il . it &apos;s called va@@ po@@ ri@@ z@@ ation .
i think it &apos;s a great challenge .
and the third part of this is that we &apos;ve all agre@@ ed , non@@ eth@@ eless , on the really extraordinary capac@@ i@@ ties that children have -- their capac@@ i@@ ties for innovation . i mean , si@@ ren@@ a last night was a mar@@ v@@ el , wasn &apos;t she ? just seeing what she could do .
they just swit@@ ched , that was it .
to willi@@ am shak@@ esp@@ ea@@ re , &quot; and put the pen@@ cil down .
if you were to visit education , as an ali@@ en , and say &quot; what &apos;s it for , public education ? &quot;
and the conse@@ quence is that many highly tal@@ ent@@ ed , brilliant , creative people think they &apos;re not , because the thing they were good at at school wasn &apos;t valu@@ ed , or was actually sti@@ g@@ mati@@ zed .
i say , &quot; ter@@ ry , please , i &apos;m trying to fr@@ y an eg@@ g in here . give me a break . &quot;
and for the future , it won &apos;t serve us .
it &apos;s still going strong , with positive press to die for .
let &apos;s just say &quot; value for money . &quot;
and notice two of them are wearing head@@ scar@@ ves , and yes , even they can l@@ augh .
for inspiration , go to one of our f@@ es@@ tiv@@ als , go online , drop us a line .
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i &apos;ve won .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot; th@@ ur@@ s@@ day : confidence is key .
and i &apos;m not a trained academ@@ ic . ne@@ i@@ ther am i a vet@@ er@@ an social wor@@ ker .
and that ro@@ of@@ top did not have any ce@@ iling , only half a tin she@@ et .

we want to continue with this program and ex@@ tend it to all our other schools .
such beautiful food ,
he was beg@@ ging by a bus stop a few years ago , got picked up and is now in an or@@ phan@@ age , has been coming to school for the last four and a half months .
but i was thinking about this , and i realized that although my new book makes me happy , and i think would make my mother happy , it &apos;s not really about happiness .
they think , well , you know , figu@@ ring out what people think about co@@ la &apos;s not that easy .
then the next person came to him , and that was camp@@ bell &apos;s sou@@ p .
howard doesn &apos;t believe that there is such a thing .
as howard lo@@ ves to say , &quot; the mind knows not what the ton@@ gue wants . &quot;
it &apos;s to make them turn their back on what they think they like now , and reach out for something higher up the mu@@ st@@ ard hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y .
itali@@ an tom@@ a@@ to sauce is what ? it &apos;s bl@@ ended ; it &apos;s th@@ in .
if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a type of coffee , a bre@@ w -- that made all of you happy , and then i asked you to rate that coffee , the average s@@ core in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 .
you don &apos;t have the pu@@ stu@@ les or the red@@ ness and infl@@ am@@ mation .
but i have some good news for you , because i &apos;m a journalis@@ t , i like to end things in a happy way or a for@@ war@@ d-@@ thinking way .
i went to medical school , and i didn &apos;t have a course called how to think s@@ ke@@ p@@ tically , or how not to order tests .
&lt; transcript &gt;
right , it &apos;s true .
and it &apos;s that third one , especially , where visions of the future begin to manif@@ est themselves .
and there &apos;s also a balance between the visible and the invisible in com@@ ics .
and i found my personal answer for this in those ancient com@@ ics that i was showing you .
it will adap@@ t . it will
now , i &apos;ve got a story for you .
even as a child , i remember thinking that what i really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communicate it to everyone else .
here was a pal@@ in im@@ person@@ ator quot@@ ing pal@@ in word for word .
why is this rem@@ ot@@ ely contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al ?
and jo@@ el was expl@@ aining to me that , because us@@ a today was one of america &apos;s four pap@@ ers of record , it would be scann@@ ed by virtu@@ ally everyone in attend@@ ance at the conference , which meant that , if he hit it out of the park with his carto@@ on on mon@@ day , the opening day of the conference , it could get passed around at the highest level among actual decis@@ i@@ on-@@ makers .

being sol@@ em@@ n is easy .
perf@@ ection happens during sol@@ em@@ n play .
and to do stuff that wasn &apos;t made out of hel@@ ve@@ ti@@ ca was actually kind of hard because you had to find it .
and in that moment of desire and focus , he can win .
here &apos;s an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called &quot; mind games . &quot;
don@@ ors &apos; walls made out of lu@@ c@@ ite .
so i began doing this crazy presentation of these install@@ ations -- potential install@@ ations -- on these under@@ pass bri@@ d@@ ges , and stood up in front of the city coun@@ cil -- and was a little bit scar@@ ed , i have to admit .
somebody was up at my house and saw the paint@@ ings and re@@ comm@@ ended them to a gall@@ ery , and i had a first show about two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half years ago , and i showed these paint@@ ings that i &apos;m showing you now .
they don &apos;t like that . they think it &apos;s cr@@ ank . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s cr@@ ank .
but as this ring rot@@ ates at about 1,@@ 700 r@@ pm -- that &apos;s 28 times per second .
this piece , actually , will be on display down in the si@@ er@@ ra simul@@ cast l@@ oun@@ ge in the brea@@ ks between now and the end of the show .
now this is typically how you see sun@@ fish , this is where they get their common name .
600 million . now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby , and you had to feed this thing .
i think donne wrote a po@@ em about that .
i mean what other kind of fish , if you approach it right , will say , &quot; okay , scr@@ at@@ ch me right there . &quot;
as the sun comes up , you see in the blue , they start their di@@ ve .
you just don &apos;t hear that every day .
one day a one-@@ ey@@ ed monkey came into the forest .

last year , i told you the story , in seven minutes , of project or@@ ion , which was this very impl@@ au@@ sible technology that techn@@ ically could have worked , but it had this one-@@ year political window where it could have happened . so it didn &apos;t happen . it was a dream that did not happen .
and then we jump to v@@ on neu@@ mann , 19@@ 45 , when he sort of re@@ inv@@ ents the whole same thing .
so we both go back to the birth of this thing .
this is the arch@@ et@@ y@@ pe of the hard dis@@ k that &apos;s in your machine now .
&quot; dam@@ n it , i can be just as stu@@ b@@ born as this thing . &quot;
i know when i &apos;m lic@@ ked . &quot;
and he published it . it wasn &apos;t loc@@ ked up and dis@@ appeared .
so , when i went into these archi@@ ves looking at this stuff , lo and beh@@ old , the archi@@ vis@@ t came up one day , saying , &quot; i think we found another box that had been thro@@ wn out . &quot;

ben dun@@ la@@ p talks about a passionate life
he had been born in 19@@ 0@@ 3 in the pro@@ v@@ in@@ ces of the old austr@@ o-@@ hun@@ gar@@ ian empire , in what later would become y@@ u@@ go@@ sl@@ av@@ ia .
and there , mr. tes@@ z@@ ler began all over again and once again achiev@@ ed immense success , especially after he invented the process for manufactu@@ ring a new fabri@@ c called doub@@ le-@@ k@@ n@@ it .
do you have any other questions ? &quot;
i deli@@ vered a lecture in which i described history as , on the whole , a ti@@ d@@ al wave of human suffering and bru@@ tal@@ ity , and mr. tes@@ z@@ ler came up to me after@@ wards with gent@@ le re@@ pro@@ ach and said , &quot; you know , doctor , human beings are fundament@@ ally good . &quot;
mr. milli@@ ken said it was not . dr. rob@@ ic@@ se@@ k dis@@ agre@@ ed .
it needed a context , a culture , a community of other vag@@ in@@ as .
in w@@ est@@ ches@@ ter they call it a &quot; po@@ ok@@ y , &quot; in new jer@@ sey a &quot; tw@@ at . &quot;
and it happens log@@ ically and organ@@ ically and tru@@ th@@ fully .
it has taken me to ju@@ ar@@ ez , mexico , where i was a week ago , where i have literally been there in parking lots where b@@ ones of women have wash@@ ed up and been du@@ mped next to coca@@ -@@ co@@ la bot@@ tles .
and at that time we did this extraordinary v@@ -@@ day at ma@@ dis@@ on square garden where we sold out the entire tes@@ to@@ ster@@ one-@@ filled dom@@ e , 18@@ ,000 people standing up to say &quot; yes &quot; to vag@@ in@@ as , which was really a pretty incredible transformation .
and everyone was supposed to be happy in that community and , in fact , my life was hell . i lived with an al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic father who beat me and mol@@ es@@ ted me , and it was all inside that .
but he was a passionate teacher , and i remember one of our earlier classes with him , he was proj@@ ecting images on the wall , asking us to think about them , and he put up an image of a painting .
and in about 199@@ 7 , the th@@ en-@@ director phili@@ ppe de mon@@ te@@ b@@ ell@@ o gave me the go@@ -@@ ahead to organiz@@ e an exhi@@ bi@@ tion for 2002 . we normally have these very long lea@@ d-@@ in times .
and in this extraordinary setting , the co@@ stu@@ mes were like actors and ac@@ tr@@ esses , or living sculp@@ tures .
i want to put people in a contem@@ pl@@ ative frame of mind , where they &apos;re prepared to be a little bit lost , to explore , to see the un@@ familiar in the familiar , or to try the unknown .
but sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nur@@ ses , and we are physi@@ cally getting ex@@ hau@@ sted to see all of them .
d@@ m : as my mother said , we are the future hope , and the men are only killing in som@@ alia .
when the war broke out -- civil war -- i saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help , and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in som@@ alia and help the women and children .
and really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
i &apos;m going to take you on a 16@@ -@@ minute trip on 7@@ 2 percent of the planet , so bu@@ ck@@ le up .
we are always , constantly playing the zero sum game .
because it &apos;s along the axis of the mi@@ d-@@ ocean ri@@ dge where the great cru@@ st@@ al pl@@ ates are separ@@ ating .
it was hot . it wasn &apos;t hot enough .
we did not know about this life system .
again , you know , we stop at the water &apos;s edge .
we expect to start hau@@ ling out the bodies in perfect condition with their dna .
but then it &apos;s connected through internet too -- the new internet high@@ way that makes internet one look like a dir@@ t road on the information high@@ way -- with 10 gig@@ ab@@ its of band@@ wid@@ th .

i was so fascin@@ ated by that oxygen commercial .
&quot; for sale : white tr@@ ash comp@@ actor . &quot;
and i was sort of , as i was starting to analy@@ ze what exactly it is that i do , i read a book called &quot; tric@@ k@@ ster makes this world , &quot; by le@@ w@@ is hy@@ de .
you &apos;re young . i &apos;m old . who &apos;s going to see it ?
you know , the to@@ es of the g@@ ec@@ ko , cur@@ ling and un@@ cur@@ ling like the fingers of michael mo@@ sch@@ en .
and the daughter says , as t@@ act@@ fully as possible , &quot; mom , are you aware that you just went through two red lights ? &quot;
thank you very much . &lt; / transcript &gt;
so let &apos;s start . number 10 : we lose the will to survive .
it &apos;s becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist el@@ se@@ where in the universe , and probably fairly close to us , is a fairly remote idea .
somewhere in the amaz@@ on forest is the mar@@ gin@@ al tree .
they are exp@@ ecting to create little , tiny black holes .
when the star@@ link disaster happened , there was a bat@@ tle between the ep@@ a and the f@@ da over who really had authority , and over what parts of this , and they didn &apos;t get it strai@@ gh@@ ten@@ ed out for months . that &apos;s kind of crazy .
start ter@@ ra@@ forming mars . this is one of my favorite subj@@ ects . i wrote a story about this in life magazine in 199@@ 3 .
we have a real , major out@@ break of disease in the united states , we are not prepared to c@@ ope with it .
it had the effect of about 1,000 hi@@ ro@@ sh@@ im@@ a bomb@@ s .
but it &apos;s going to take them 10 years , at spending three million dollars a year , and even then , they claim they &apos;ll only have about 80 percent of them cat@@ alo@@ gu@@ ed .
the worst thing we can do is say , je@@ ez , i got enough to worry about without wor@@ rying about an astero@@ id .
i hope it will be .
this is very , very important because this is the system , this is the cruci@@ ble , out of which life on the planet came ,
now you &apos;ve heard of hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents , but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor , there is vast reser@@ voir of micro@@ bi@@ al activity , which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study .
it &apos;s a new world .
it &apos;ll be , in a sense , like having time on a telescope , except you &apos;ll have your own port .
so what can we actually do tomorrow ?
deli@@ vering the power and the band@@ wid@@ th into the ocean will dra@@ ma@@ tically acceler@@ ate adap@@ tation .
he won the nobel prize for literature in 19@@ 4@@ 8 .
some of the ice in the ic@@ e@@ ber@@ gs that i photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
but to create a space that never exis@@ ted is what interests me ;
and today we have a kind of ev@@ ang@@ eli@@ cal pes@@ sim@@ ism all around us .
it is actually a living connection to the cos@@ mic event that we are part of , and a story that is certainly on@@ going .
so the important thing actually , is to introduce the actual architec@@ tural dimensions , which might be totally in@@ expli@@ cable in words ,
so i do believe that architecture as i see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have , in every in@@ tim@@ acy that we poss@@ ess .
so the un@@ expected is always un@@ expected .
so i believe that my main interest is to memory .
you know it costs a lot of money and so on , but yes , it should not play it safe .
so democracy , as difficult as it is , i believe in it .
i came from the bronx . i was taught not to be a lo@@ ser ,
a him@@ ba is one of the 29 ethni@@ c groups in nam@@ i@@ bia .
then in the same time , around 19@@ 80 , we had a very big dr@@ ought . it killed almost everything that was left .
at every him@@ ba village , there is a sac@@ red fire .
they have also given fun@@ ding for two decades to this whole program .
secon@@ dly , we put it for infrastructure . food .
so what do we call this ?
the problem is we are hi@@ ding that cost bene@@ ath the waves .
there &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in gre@@ ening our food systems .
sh@@ ell@@ fish , mus@@ sel@@ s , oy@@ sters , cl@@ ams , ti@@ lap@@ ia , cha@@ r -- these were the common species .

there is great con@@ fusion when the two look at each other .
so , having seen all of this in the course of a 3@@ 0-@@ year career , i was still a s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic about climate change until about 10 years ago , because i thought the story of climate change was based on computer models .
we just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere , watching what &apos;s happened .
in the past hundred years , the temperature of the earth has gone up 1.@@ 3 degrees fa@@ h@@ ren@@ he@@ it , .@@ 75 degrees cel@@ si@@ us , and it &apos;s going to keep going up because we keep du@@ mp@@ ing fossil fu@@ els into the atmosphere .
this is something no self-@@ resp@@ ecting photograp@@ her would ever do -- you put some che@@ es@@ y illustr@@ ation on your shot , right ? -- and yet you have to do it sometimes to narr@@ ate these points .
if you line up 2@@ 95 of those no@@ se to tail , that &apos;s about how far back that was .
it &apos;s flo@@ wing out to the atlan@@ tic ocean on the left .
and that &apos;s where i think organizations like ted , like the extreme ice surve@@ y can have a terri@@ fic impact on human perception and bring us along .

so , look at the beauty from the desert society who can harv@@ est rain@@ water , and also create something through a ti@@ re from a j@@ et plane , and used in a cam@@ el car@@ t .
ted fellow and journalis@@ t ev@@ gen@@ y mor@@ o@@ zo@@ v pun@@ c@@ tures what he calls &quot; ipo@@ d liber@@ alism &quot; -- the assu@@ mption that tech innovation always prom@@ otes freedom , democracy -- with ch@@ illing examples of ways the internet helps op@@ pres@@ sive reg@@ im@@ es sti@@ f@@ le dis@@ sent .
and again , i think this is kind of fal@@ se .
but then auth@@ ori@@ ties did something very smart .
right ? so they can go online and contribu@@ te ideas on what that region would look like by the year 20@@ 20 .
so the way i tend to think of it is like a hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y of cyber@@ -@@ needs in space ,
it didn &apos;t matter what she was cr@@ ying about , she could get on my k@@ ne@@ e , she could s@@ not my sle@@ eve up , just cr@@ y , cr@@ y it out .
my mother , my sister , my au@@ n@@ tie , they all get out , but my father and i st@@ ayed in the lim@@ ous@@ ine ,
he was being raised by his grandmother .
women are objects , especially sexu@@ al objects .
and i zi@@ p my p@@ ants up in front of them , and i head for the door .
in fact , the american publi@@ sh@@ ers of my book , &quot; the ele@@ phant , the ti@@ ger and the cell phone , &quot; added a gratu@@ it@@ ous sub@@ title saying , &quot; india : the next 21@@ st-@@ century power . &quot;
india has more all@@ -@@ news tv ch@@ ann@@ els than any country in the world , in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together .
you know , if you visit friends in the su@@ bur@@ bs of delhi , on the side streets you will find a fellow with a car@@ t that looks like it was designed in the 16@@ th century , wi@@ el@@ ding a co@@ al-@@ fi@@ red stea@@ m ir@@ on that might have been invented in the 18@@ th century .
she &apos;s illi@@ ter@@ ate , so she can &apos;t read the french sub@@ ti@@ tles .
this can sometimes have un@@ int@@ ended consequences . ok .
it was essentially india being itself .
we have to over@@ come our poverty . we have to deal with the hard@@ ware of development , the ports , the roads , the air@@ ports , all the infrastruc@@ tural things we need to do , and the software of development , the human capital , the need for the ordinary person in india to be able to have a couple of square me@@ als a day , to be able to send his or her children to a dec@@ ent school , and to asp@@ ire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves .
you literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to ba@@ the .
k@@ ary mul@@ l@@ is &apos; n@@ ex@@ t-@@ gen cure for kill@@ er infec@@ tions
it &apos;s like this very fast , very efficient way to get people off the street .
and they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong .
so then there &apos;s also my favorite example of susp@@ ended animation .
doctors have a saying that , in fact , &quot; you &apos;re not dead until you &apos;re warm and dead . &quot;
and so , we were thinking about that , about this relationship between these things , and thinking about whether or not that &apos;s what happened to the ski@@ er .
it &apos;s an extraordin@@ arily tox@@ ic thing .
now , in this state of de-@@ animation , it could not go out d@@ ancing , but it was not dead , and it was not har@@ med .
i want to mention that , first of all , my wife , without whom this talk and my work would not be possible , so thank you very much .
do you know of any car that didn ’ t have a maker ? yes / no .
we became bal@@ d-@@ bo@@ died , o@@ dd@@ ly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t .
it ’ s a neur@@ al system that ’ s wired up to reward the brain for doing a gr@@ u@@ bby cl@@ eri@@ cal job .
before foun@@ ding ide@@ o , david said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends .
i want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage .
well , at least , we did once .
okay . put down your pen@@ c@@ ils , as they say .
he gave each of them some mes@@ cal@@ ine , and had them listen to some nice , rela@@ x@@ ing music for a while .
well , it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and nor@@ ms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process .
often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution .
but what about designing something that isn ’ t physical ?
and so they gr@@ ab@@ bed some very simple materials , you can see , and did this ro@@ le-@@ play , this kind of very cru@@ de ro@@ le-@@ play , just to get a sense of what it would be like for pass@@ eng@@ ers if they were stuck in quite small places on air@@ planes .
when kids play tea party , or they play cop@@ s and rob@@ bers , they ’ re following a s@@ cript that they ’ ve agre@@ ed to .
because it ’ s very easy to fall into the tra@@ p that these states are absolute .
i can just sit back and rela@@ x . &quot;
and he put me on anti-@@ de@@ press@@ ants .
because that is not only how we achieve success , it &apos;s how we sust@@ ain it .
and so i figured for mexico and bab@@ es , i could do just about anything .
so i wrote on my blog , &quot; om@@ g om@@ g . &quot;
and scot@@ t ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated all of the videos .
beau aw@@ tin : ♫ safe in bed ♫ e@@ w : and our goal -- it was sort of an ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary goal -- there was an m@@ tv video where they all sang &quot; lo@@ l@@ li@@ pop &quot; and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little mel@@ o@@ dy .
it doesn &apos;t matter the technology .
just like today .
and it &apos;s a little bit iron@@ ic that we set about to dis@@ ru@@ pt traditional education , and in doing so , we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes .
but to me , the most exciting part of it is the data that we &apos;re gather@@ ing .
and so this guy gets the sn@@ ail all set up and gives it a good wh@@ ack .
and so what we did is , we took a look at these videos , and we measu@@ red how fast the lim@@ b was moving to get back to that original question .
and it &apos;s surr@@ ounded by mem@@ bran@@ ous areas . and those mem@@ bran@@ ous areas sugges@@ ted to me that maybe this is some kind of dynam@@ ically flexi@@ ble structure .
that &apos;s a bit long , but it is sort of interesting .
so now , you &apos;d expect a second peak for other reasons , but not half a milli@@ second later .
and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy sto@@ red with that speci@@ alized spring , but the extre@@ mes of the flu@@ id dynam@@ ics . and they might actually be making use of flu@@ id dynam@@ ics as a second force for breaking the sn@@ ail .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
if i held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth , and i held up another square that was the ro@@ ot two square -- so it ’ s 1.@@ 5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans ; and i said , what is the relative value of these two things ?
it gener@@ ates all of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy , all of the pay@@ load for the craft , and the batteries are down here hang@@ ing underneath , exactly like a ballo@@ on .
i don ’ t know of any other submer@@ sible , or even remote , that just takes advantage that this is a three-@@ dimensional space .
and then by moving through the water it ’ s able to take that control .
you see the larger wing area here .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
if you look here at this map , showing everything in blue is out in the water , and everything in yellow is u@@ pl@@ and .
so again , we got the short end of the deal there .
so you can imagine s@@ cu@@ ba di@@ ving here .
no , what i want to do is take you back to 18@@ 5@@ 4 in london for the next few minutes , and tell the story -- in bri@@ ef -- of this out@@ break , which in many ways , i think , helped create the world that we live in today , and particularly the kind of city that we live in today .
and so one of the foun@@ ding moments of public health in the 19@@ th century effectively pois@@ oned the water supply of london much more effectively than any modern day bi@@ ot@@ er@@ r@@ or@@ ist could have ever dre@@ am@@ ed of doing .
this guy , hen@@ ry whit@@ e@@ head , who was a local minister , who was not at all a man of science , but was incredibly soci@@ ally connected ;
and so that in a way is the ultimate leg@@ acy of this map .
and he spent 33 years in prison .
and i usually hand out po@@ lar@@ o@@ ids when i do these , because i &apos;m setting up lights , and chec@@ king my lights , and when i showed her her po@@ lar@@ o@@ id , she scre@@ am@@ ed and ran into her tent .
and her tri@@ be has had to move three times in the last 10 years because of the oil sp@@ ills .
i think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clas@@ h of beli@@ efs taking place .
the other thing : i wanted to give indi@@ gen@@ ous people a voice .
how did it get into the form that it had before it got res@@ hap@@ ed , and so forth ?
we draw this set of nes@@ ted sp@@ her@@ es cut away so you see it .
and then you see this sort of model area around the outside , and that is the radiation coming from the big bang , which is actually incredibly uni@@ form .
now i &apos;m going to show you this in 3d .
there &apos;s a more complicated process going on here .
this one we &apos;re zo@@ om@@ ing in on is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region .
and we &apos;re going to fly around , and we &apos;ll fly around , and you &apos;ll see occa@@ sion@@ ally a couple of fil@@ am@@ ents inter@@ s@@ ect , and you get a large clu@@ ster of galaxies .
and this is a simple one , because it doesn &apos;t have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it .
ge@@ ology has these effects , which is moving the pl@@ ates around and so forth .
in fact , we spend more time looking after our cars , our clo@@ thes and our hair than we
my own way of dealing with it was to become a mon@@ k .
it &apos;s a very un@@ comfortable way to live life , when you get this ti@@ ght and str@@ essed .
that &apos;s the potential of me@@ dit@@ ation , of min@@ d@@ ful@@ ness .
so if the field &apos;s been around for so long , why so few clinical adv@@ ances ?
so they know what to do . the cells gene@@ tically know what to do , and they start be@@ ating together .
you can hold it like a li@@ ver , but it has no cells ; it &apos;s just a skelet@@ on of the li@@ ver .
patients are dying every day because we don &apos;t have enough of those organs to go around .
i &apos;m going to share with you a clip in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while .
and saved my life .
and i did know how the al@@ um@@ ni of various schools back in the 3@@ 0s jud@@ ged co@@ aches and ath@@ le@@ tic te@@ ams .
and i think that character is much more important than what you are perce@@ ived to be .
but yet again i may . and later i may say , i knew him once , and he was wea@@ k , or strong , or b@@ old or proud or g@@ ay .
most of them are young , you know , and probably new@@ ly married .
and i say to you , in whatever you &apos;re doing , you must be patient . you have to have pati@@ ence to -- we want things to happen . we talk about our you@@ th being im@@ patient a lot .
of hoping when our dreams are dead ;
i liked our -- as a bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball co@@ ach at u@@ c@@ la i liked our practi@@ ces to be the journey , and the game would be the end . the end result .
ne@@ i@@ ther one of those youn@@ g@@ sters could shoot very well .
but let &apos;s face it , when you &apos;ve watched it once maybe , or twice , you don &apos;t really want to watch it again , because you know how jack b@@ au@@ er is going to de@@ fe@@ at the terror@@ ists .
what i find fascinating is that we &apos;ve actually wired our world to share , whether that &apos;s our neighborhood , our school , our office , or our facebook network ,
all of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008 , when , of course , the great financial crash happened .
it &apos;s one of those ideas that &apos;s so simple , yet brilliant , you wonder why it &apos;s never been done before .
in other words , the car ad@@ dic@@ ts had lost their ur@@ ge to own .
it &apos;s a new social curr@@ ency , so to speak , that could become as powerful as our credit r@@ ating .
i &apos;m a ph@@ d student at mit , and i happen to study atmo@@ sp@@ her@@ ic science .
we don &apos;t need any more free@@ z@@ ers .
mo : so we decided to build them -- a re@@ co@@ very in a box , something that could be de@@ plo@@ yed after every disaster by any local organiz@@ er .
now that ex@@ pense can be huge , but if the town can mobi@@ li@@ ze x amount of volunte@@ ers for y hours , the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town &apos;s contribu@@ tion .
there are over three volunte@@ er groups working almost every day , and have been since j@@ une 1@@ st of last year , to make sure that these res@@ id@@ ents get what they need and get back in their homes .
so , i had been there almost three months , and i was tour@@ ing around the city going to different s@@ quat@@ ter areas and juli@@ us was tag@@ ging along , and he was bu@@ g ey@@ ed and at certain points we were walking around , he gr@@ ab@@ bed my hand for support , which is something most ken@@ y@@ ans would never consider doing .
1.@@ 5 million people stu@@ ff@@ ed into mu@@ d or metal hu@@ ts with no services , no toil@@ ets , no rights .
once you have st@@ ayed here , you cannot go back . &apos; he meant back beyond that mountain of tr@@ ash , back in the legal city , of legal buildings , with legal le@@ ases and legal rights .
that &apos;s also in ist@@ an@@ bu@@ l , tur@@ key .
talk about more plastic bag@@ s than plan@@ k@@ ton . and sometimes they have natural tr@@ ash@@ -@@ dispos@@ al .
this is richard mu@@ th@@ ama peter , and he is an it@@ in@@ er@@ ant street photograp@@ her in ki@@ ber@@ a . he makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood , and the people in the neighborhood , and is a great resource in the community .
and all of a sudden i passed the national examin@@ ation , found myself in a very beautiful high school in kenya .
and these guys took off , followed the foot@@ steps of the vill@@ agers until they found and passed them .
gre@@ g@@ ory pet@@ sk@@ o on the coming neuro@@ logical epidemic
and there ’ s tremendous scope for ad@@ di@@ tional private help here , because the government has dro@@ pped the ball on much of this , i ’ m afraid .
if you search for the word &quot; technology , &quot; it was not used until 195@@ 2 .
and if we study those hun@@ ter@@ -@@ gather@@ er tri@@ bes and the ne@@ ander@@ thal , which are very similar to early man ,
the other thing that the early man invented was fire .
it &apos;s continu@@ ally to re@@ invent ourselves .
and there are things moving towards greater complexity , moving towards greater diversity , moving towards greater speci@@ alization , senti@@ ence , u@@ bi@@ qu@@ ity and most important , evol@@ v@@ ability :
when king hen@@ ry of england died ,
nuclear energy , fis@@ sion , is really bad idea for bomb@@ s .
so that i think technology lo@@ ves biology ,
and one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
you &apos;ve got@@ ta sell something .
and we sat . and at 2 : 30 p@@ .@@ m. we put a sandwich board out on the front si@@ de@@ walk and it just said , &quot; free tu@@ tor@@ ing for your eng@@ li@@ sh@@ -@@ related and writ@@ ing@@ -@@ related needs -- just come in , it &apos;s all free . &quot;
and so our intern@@ s were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoul@@ der@@ -@@ to-@@ shoul@@ der , compu@@ ter@@ -@@ n@@ ex@@ t-@@ to-@@ computer with the students .
so that &apos;s part@@ ly why the tu@@ tor corps grew so fast .
they work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
and once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
so all the people i used to know in bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n , they said , &quot; well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
all the designers , all of the buil@@ ders , everybody was local , all the time was pro@@ -@@ bon@@ o .
so you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7@@ -@@ el@@ even would be .
if you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . he &apos;ll be on the phone .
ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging that god is unknown and un@@ know@@ able by definition .
now the un@@ changing god feels a bit cold and in@@ different to me .
either god is responsible for the tsunami , or god is not in control .
we cannot afford to pay so much for ad@@ mission .
in the tsunami , in the vic@@ ti@@ ms . in the dep@@ th of things .
it needs a profound attenti@@ ven@@ ess and a patient waiting ,
this is not a story of a nam@@ eless someone who lived in some war , who we do not know their hop@@ es , their dreams , their accompli@@ sh@@ ments , their families , their beli@@ efs , their values .
a palestin@@ ian woman once told me , &quot; it is not about the fear of one death , &quot; she said , &quot; sometimes i feel i die 10 times in one day , &quot; as she was descri@@ bing the mar@@ ches of soldiers and the sounds of their bul@@ lets .
we are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the mid@@ st of wars .
there is no way we can talk about the building of st@@ ability if we don &apos;t start inves@@ ting in women and girls .
ideas , language , even the phrase &apos; each other &apos; no longer makes any sense . &quot;
by the way was b@@ ann@@ ed by the f@@ c@@ c ,
and i know there are people here , the youn@@ ger generation who want to be hip@@ pi@@ es ,
the creativity that allowed us , that we were requi@@ red to have to conce@@ ive and build and laun@@ ch the space shu@@ t@@ tle , spr@@ ings from the same source as the imagination and
you know , people say intuitive , you know that &apos;s like you &apos;re in touch with nature ,
it &apos;s kind of a book about questions , questions about simpli@@ city .
so i &apos;m mostly driving along , okay , and then i saw this sign .
but looking way back , when i was a child -- you see , i grew up in a to@@ f@@ u factory in seat@@ tle .
and also i@@ k@@ ko tan@@ ak@@ a was a very important ment@@ or in my life -- the paul r@@ and of japan . he designed most of the major ic@@ ons of japan , like is@@ sey mi@@ y@@ a@@ ke &apos;s brand and also mu@@ j@@ i .
i did this series of cal@@ end@@ ars for sh@@ is@@ ei@@ do .
so , to get off the tree , i began to use my old computers .
i discovered that che@@ et@@ os are good , expres@@ sive material .
you know the uni is the most challeng@@ ing , so number ten is challeng@@ ing . people hate number ten like they hate uni , actually .
and so , this whole thing has stru@@ ck me as exciting to be here , because life is fin@@ ite .
i &apos;m giving a short slide show this morning that i &apos;m giving for the very first time , so -- well it &apos;s -- i don &apos;t want or need to raise the bar ,
let me show you these sli@@ des here .
if it &apos;s more being tr@@ apped on the way out , then you would expect it to be war@@ mer here and co@@ ol@@ er here . here is the lower atmosphere .
put a price on carbon . we need a co2 ta@@ x , reven@@ ue neutr@@ al , to re@@ place tax@@ ation on employ@@ ment , which was invented by bis@@ mar@@ ck -- and some things have changed since the 19@@ th century .
we now have a culture of dis@@ tr@@ action .
this challenge is part of the fabri@@ c of our whole civilization .
a new appreci@@ ation for the privil@@ e@@ ge that we have of under@@ taking this challenge .
the first step we did was to collect . we did 1@@ 30 different sources of information -- from n@@ go re@@ ports to newsp@@ ap@@ ers and cable news .
this wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
why should these different -- seem@@ ingly different conflic@@ ts have the same patterns ?
and the system gets per@@ tur@@ bed . it moves up@@ wards to a frag@@ ment@@ ed state .
but designers are great at taking big re@@ volu@@ tions that happen and transform@@ ing them so that we can use them .
and it &apos;s really interesting to see how this happens .
then , he took the sc@@ ans of the best organs and made the meat --
so the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future ,
it &apos;s a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this v@@ ase . they had a particular shape that they had to stay in .
the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad break@@ up , what you miss the most are those an@@ no@@ ying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person .
medical eth@@ ic@@ ist har@@ ve@@ y fin@@ e@@ berg shows us three pa@@ ths forward for the ever@@ -@@ evol@@ ving human species : to stop evol@@ ving completely , to evol@@ ve naturally -- or to control the next steps of human evolution , using genetic modi@@ fication , to make ourselves smar@@ ter , faster , better . ne@@ o-@@ evolution is within our gr@@ as@@ p . what will we do with it ?
the great 20@@ th-@@ century gene@@ tic@@ ist , t@@ .@@ g@@ . do@@ b@@ z@@ h@@ ans@@ ky , who was also a communic@@ ant in the russi@@ an or@@ tho@@ do@@ x church , once wrote an ess@@ ay that he ti@@ tled &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . &quot; now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device -- i give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at ka@@ thr@@ yn sch@@ ul@@ t@@ z &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense what@@ so@@ ever to you .
but what will come in the future ?
i wanted to res@@ to@@ re health from disease .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , cho@@ os@@ ing to have more males than fem@@ ales .
why not have the quick twit@@ ch muscle that will en@@ able you to run faster and longer ?
the only trouble is the people next door ; i can &apos;t stand them . &quot;
you have to , of course , be aware of the needs of others , but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people .
you know , there &apos;s no way that you can do anything for anyone if you over@@ do things .
symbo@@ li@@ cally , what the rab@@ b@@ is say is that at pas@@ so@@ ver , what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pri@@ de , our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world , and that everything should re@@ vol@@ ve round us .
he goes in there , and it &apos;s not there .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
in fact , imagine something even worse .
if you hit your th@@ um@@ b with a ham@@ mer , these wi@@ res in your arm -- that , of course , we call ner@@ ves -- trans@@ mit the information into the jun@@ ction box in the sp@@ in@@ al cord where new wi@@ res , new ner@@ ves , take the information up to the brain where you become consci@@ ously aware that your th@@ um@@ b is now hur@@ t .
and she &apos;s doing absolutely fantastic .
you can see here , there &apos;s the y@@ u@@ cat@@ an pen@@ in@@ su@@ la , if you recognize co@@ z@@ um@@ el off the east coast there .
the object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 y@@ ards across , so roughly the size of mac@@ key audit@@ ori@@ um here .
the smaller ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a mill@@ en@@ ni@@ um , every few cent@@ u@@ ries or every few thousand years , but it &apos;s still something to be aware of .
250 meters across , so it would do un@@ believ@@ able damage .
it &apos;s like , well , you can try that , but the problem is ti@@ ming .
it doesn &apos;t have to be huge -- couple of tons , not that big -- and you park it near the astero@@ id .
65 million years from now , we don &apos;t have to have our b@@ ones collec@@ ting d@@ ust in a museum .
my story starts -- the story i want to share -- starts in 199@@ 1 .
the big plan was to ask him for a 1,@@ 00@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ dollar lo@@ an .
so third meeting , argu@@ ments are pretty well exer@@ cis@@ ed .
it &apos;s a kind of very nice , sophisticated way how to econom@@ ically str@@ angle a daily newspaper .
we believe that in the last 10 years companies that we &apos;ve fin@@ anced are actually the best media companies in the developing world .
so what the go@@ ver@@ nor got was an empty sh@@ ell .
you know , instead of people running in this dark , trying to find their own match , who will be willing , who has the same goals . instead of all of that we thought there is -- something new needs to be invented .
and in that way you organiz@@ e the financ@@ ing so there are no dark rooms , no blind people running around to find each other .
though he never would travel to europe , he went with shak@@ esp@@ ea@@ re &apos;s kin@@ gs to mer@@ ry england , he went with lor@@ d by@@ ron &apos;s poetry to sp@@ ain and por@@ tu@@ g@@ al .
he then ran twice for the sen@@ ate , lost twice .
so he put the p@@ en down .
i was sel@@ ected as a white house fellow when i was 24 years old .
and he started out , &quot; dor@@ is , more than any other woman i have ever known ... &quot;
so deep , for instance , was abra@@ ham lin@@ col@@ n &apos;s love of shak@@ esp@@ ea@@ re , that he made time to spend more than a hundred ni@@ ghts in the theater , even during those dark days of the war .
which allows me , from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall , to have something to occup@@ y my mind and heart other than my work .
he said , &quot; no problem . it wasn &apos;t a religious service . &quot;
thank you for l@@ etting me be that story@@ tel@@ ler today .
the experiments had to be wrong , and they were .
and he said , here , &quot; it is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws . &quot; the basic law , let &apos;s say -- here &apos;s an assu@@ mption .
and so what happens is that the new phenomen@@ a , the new sk@@ ins , the inner sk@@ ins of the slightly smaller sk@@ ins of the on@@ ion that we get to , res@@ emble the slightly larger ones .
but you can just look at the form . you can look at the form .
symmetry exhi@@ bits the simpli@@ city .
you don &apos;t need -- you don &apos;t need something more to get something more .
the story begins in the ir@@ an-@@ iraq war and that series of events that cul@@ min@@ ated in the inv@@ a@@ sion of iraq by foreign forces , the re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of a des@@ po@@ tic ru@@ ler and instant regi@@ me change .
so the hyper@@ bo@@ le is not actually surprising .
much more important , it was the first multi@@ cultural , multi@@ faith state on a huge scale .
it &apos;s a great 19@@ th century moment .
and the cy@@ rus cy@@ lin@@ der comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstr@@ ation of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 19@@ 18 is part of a div@@ ine plan .
and it &apos;s the subject of a huge debate about what this cy@@ lin@@ der means , what cy@@ rus means , but above all , cy@@ rus as arti@@ cul@@ ated through this cy@@ lin@@ der -- cy@@ rus as the def@@ ender of the hom@@ el@@ and , the cham@@ pi@@ on , of course , of ir@@ an@@ ian identity and of the ir@@ an@@ ian peop@@ les , tol@@ er@@ ant of all fai@@ ths .
i was basically concerned about what was going on in the world .
there was no day of global un@@ ity .
and i ran@@ g sir bob ay@@ ling , who was ce@@ o of ba at the time , and said , &quot; mate , we &apos;ve got this inv@@ itation .
and i &apos;ve always spo@@ ken to women and children wher@@ ever i &apos;ve gone .
and now i was thinking , &quot; well , the press it really going to hear this story . &quot; and suddenly , we started to institu@@ tion@@ alize this day .
and i went back to the u.n. for another couple of years .
i mean , we basically sat down with everybody -- in and out of schools with min@@ ist@@ ers of education , holding these press con@@ fer@@ ences , which of course , now were lo@@ aded with press , everybody was there .
and then there was this other st@@ atement that came out from the u.n. department of security and safety saying that , in afghanistan , because of this work , the violence was down by 70 percent .
so , utili@@ zing all of these ways to inspire individual action .
pa@@ trick aw@@ u@@ ah on educ@@ ating leaders
start all over again .
a ghana air@@ ways pil@@ ot falls into the same pre@@ di@@ ca@@ ment .
and it was brilliant to be part of this team .
this was not the world that i &apos;d want my children to grow up in .
now , a month into this project , we &apos;d just started classes .
it says a lot about her .
al@@ ber@@ to c@@ air@@ o : there are no scr@@ aps of men
it was a strange sensation .
and then i ask an even more stupid question : &quot; why don &apos;t you have the pros@@ thes@@ es ?
we have other things to do . &quot; but they ins@@ is@@ ted .
we could not possibly stay in@@ do@@ ors , with all these sand@@ bag@@ s at the windows .
he told me , &quot; he &apos;s at school . he &apos;d doing quite well . &quot; but i understood he wanted to tell me something .
only one week -- one week try and not a single day more .
and you see the faces .
we transport the whe@@ el@@ ch@@ airs everywhere .
where it sear@@ ches for planets by measur@@ ing the light from over 15@@ 0,000 stars , all at once , every half hour , and very precis@@ ely .
but what we can do in the mean@@ time is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to su@@ ss out clu@@ es about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
wrong . i &apos;m not looking at you . i can &apos;t see you .
oh , they also say they will sell you as@@ tro@@ logy or other fortun@@ et@@ elling me@@ tho@@ ds .
and she didn &apos;t answer the dam@@ n question !
and that &apos;s the kind of information they &apos;re going to bring back to you ?
now , mon@@ tel willi@@ ams is an intelligent man .
and we haven &apos;t heard from her since . strange .
what is hom@@ e@@ op@@ a@@ thy ?
and we must do something about those problems .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
those machines go the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al jun@@ k@@ y@@ ard .
35 million surger@@ ies are attemp@@ ted every year without safe an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia .
the only difference is that now you &apos;re only working with 21 percent oxygen .
is this the design that &apos;s going to work in place ?
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i &apos;m a red@@ un@@ dant person .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
so i like the way you roll , ser@@ ge@@ y br@@ in . no . this is was the problem : transpar@@ ency -- free from pre@@ ten@@ se or dec@@ e@@ it ; easily det@@ ected or seen through ; read@@ ily understood ; character@@ ized by visi@@ bility or accessi@@ bility of information , especially concer@@ ning business practi@@ ces -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
we will have them g@@ ear@@ ed for both male or female -- solid , ro@@ ll@@ -@@ on or stick , whatever it may be .
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;ve helped companies like nes@@ tle , fe@@ bre@@ ze , h@@ all@@ mark discover that brand person@@ ality .
a : yeah . all right .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , main@@ ly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
i &apos;m not a veget@@ arian -- this is the old ni@@ x@@ on line , right ?
we didn &apos;t know that pollution did more than cause bad visi@@ bility .
so , when the us@@ da finally ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged that it was plants , rather than animals , that made people healthy , they encour@@ aged us , via their over@@ ly simpli@@ stic food pyram@@ id , to eat five serv@@ ings of fruits and veget@@ ables a day , along with more car@@ bs .
how we got to this place is the history of food in the united states .
from the &apos; 3@@ 0s on , road systems exp@@ and@@ ed , tru@@ cks took the place of rai@@ l@@ roads , fresh food began to travel more .
listen to this , between 19@@ 50 and 2000 , the world &apos;s population doubl@@ ed .
sad@@ ly , it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a com@@ a , if not actually killed --
the loc@@ av@@ or@@ es , the organ@@ iv@@ or@@ es , the veget@@ ari@@ ans , the ve@@ g@@ ans , the g@@ our@@ mets and those of us who are just pl@@ ain interested in good food .
i &apos;ve been writing about food more or less om@@ ni@@ v@@ or@@ ously -- one might say in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ately -- for about 30 years .
i started a site called tre@@ e@@ hu@@ g@@ ger --
on the wee@@ k@@ end , your choice .
if i can ask an in@@ dis@@ cre@@ et question , how many of you have tat@@ to@@ os ?
my@@ th number two : or@@ ph@@ eus , wonderful guy , char@@ ming to be around , great parti@@ er , great sing@@ er , lo@@ ses his bel@@ o@@ ved , char@@ ms his way into the under@@ world , only person to char@@ m his way into the under@@ world , char@@ ms the go@@ ds of the under@@ world , they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they &apos;re out .
it seems that there &apos;s not just one person who thinks that these problems are important .
library of congr@@ ess holds 18 million volu@@ mes .
if we could eventually colon@@ ize a ch@@ un@@ k of the universe -- the vir@@ go super@@ clu@@ ster -- maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there , but if we go ext@@ inct we never will .
we might end up with something like this ,
so in a bro@@ ad sense , we don &apos;t need to think about technology as only little g@@ ad@@ gets , like these things here ,
it &apos;s also interesting to think about what other things are -- so if these all en@@ ab@@ led great values , why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the mod@@ alities we would need to engage with other values that there might be ?
and then you can imagine some enh@@ anc@@ ements of human capac@@ i@@ ties .
the sun end was about four in@@ ches in diam@@ eter ,
jh : and they &apos;re non-@@ deter@@ minis@@ tic .
and i &apos;ll do another session with it and bring it up to another level , where all of this becomes the background , the dep@@ th of it .
jh : is that a liter@@ al part of the image , or is my eye making that inter@@ ference pattern --
i mean , i &apos;ve got the symp@@ tom@@ s .
my talk is &quot; fl@@ apping birds and space tel@@ escop@@ es . &quot;
and it rai@@ ses a question : what changed ?
but if we follow the laws of origami , we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very , very simple ,
but that &apos;s the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hum@@ p .
what if i want to make something that has a lot of fl@@ aps ?
we found we could do insects , sp@@ id@@ ers , which are close , things with legs , things with legs and wings , things with legs and anten@@ na@@ e .
one of the ear@@ li@@ est was this pattern , this fol@@ ded pattern , studied by k@@ or@@ yo mi@@ ur@@ a , a japanese engineer .
and it works perfectly on its test range , and it indeed fol@@ ds up into a ne@@ at little bun@@ d@@ le .
thanks .
so my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually correspon@@ ded to my own experience , i tried to understand : where -- in everyday life , in our normal experience -- do we feel really happy ?
you can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
she is the foun@@ der of body shop , the natural cos@@ me@@ tics king .
it &apos;s not very challeng@@ ing any more .
women , for the first time this year , became the majority of the american work@@ force .
i was reading head@@ lines about the rec@@ ession just like anyone else , and i started to notice a dist@@ inct pattern -- that the rec@@ ession was aff@@ ecting men much more deeply than it was aff@@ ecting women .
now what does that mean ?
you would be issu@@ ing or@@ ders from above .
and some people say it &apos;s because , in 9@@ th grade , boys start dro@@ pping out of school .
and the instruc@@ tor was up there in the class expl@@ aining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age .
and now look at the char@@ t .
so the image that i like to think of , instead of glass ce@@ iling , is the high bridge .
f@@ n : and i also had an interest in dangerous inv@@ entions .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
the world population has doubl@@ ed since i went to school .
and i list@@ ened to what &apos;s happening in china ,
here i have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children -- big families , small families .
it &apos;s only by child survival that we will stop population growth .
and they were competi@@ tive about this : &quot; you pom@@ mi@@ es , your rates of heart disease are sho@@ cking . &quot;
and the evidence for it prev@@ ent@@ ing cancers is not yet great .
and i first off started work in cell culture , growing cells , and then i was using kno@@ ck@@ out mouse models -- mi@@ ce that couldn &apos;t make the gene .
a few good things here : this appeared to be more mar@@ ked in older people .
in winter or summer , it &apos;s the same amount of light .
an@@ th@@ on@@ y at@@ al@@ a &apos;s stat@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the-@@ art lab gro@@ ws human organs -- from muscles to blood v@@ ess@@ els to bl@@ ad@@ ders , and more . at ted@@ med , he shows foot@@ age of his bio@@ -@@ engineers working with some of its sci@@ -@@ fi gi@@ z@@ mo@@ s , including an o@@ ven@@ -@@ like bio@@ re@@ actor and a machine that &quot; print@@ s &quot; human tissue .
we &apos;ve talked about stem cells ton@@ ight .
so , how can we har@@ ness that power ?
and that &apos;s what we did for this piece of muscle .
and this is an x-@@ ray showing you the pat@@ ent , functi@@ onal blood ves@@ sel .
we take the sca@@ ff@@ old , we seed it with cells , and you can now see here , the val@@ ve lea@@ fl@@ ets opening and clo@@ sing .
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use dec@@ el@@ lu@@ lar@@ ized organs .
one of the things that i wanted to sum@@ mar@@ ize for you then is what is a strategy that we &apos;re going for in re@@ gener@@ ative medicine .
but it takes a lot to get there .
thank you for your attention .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
and it was only when he had reach@@ ed the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from men@@ stru@@ ating intern@@ ally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female intern@@ ally .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanz@@ ees .
and the mon@@ arch@@ y was basically based on a very simpli@@ stic concept of anatom@@ y .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that com@@ mon@@ ality , we have to begin to question why we maint@@ ain certain divis@@ ions .
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromosom@@ es .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and i &apos;ve never spo@@ ken about this ever , until now -- so this is the first time anyone &apos;s ever heard it , except my wife three days ago , because she said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot; and i told her -- is that i think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepren@@ eu@@ ri@@ al traits , and to gro@@ om them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing .
if you teach a man to fish , you feed him for a lifetime . &quot;
attention de@@ fic@@ it dis@@ order , bi@@ po@@ lar dis@@ order .
and we &apos;ve heard those things about &quot; is it nur@@ ture or is it nature , &quot; right ?
and i remember this one custom@@ er so vivi@@ dly because i also did some other stuff with these clients .
i also learned , don &apos;t re@@ v@@ eal your source , because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my com@@ ics from , and he didn &apos;t like the fact that he was paying a lot more .
and you could stuff p@@ ins in them .
and they &apos;d give me their or@@ ders for the following week .
so i sold lots and lots of sun@@ gl@@ asses .
they go around looking for what it is .
when you see gr@@ u@@ mp@@ y custom@@ er service , point that out to them .
these skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom
but for me , unlike them , in my world , the s@@ late was not clean ,
this aver@@ sion to social values may seem at od@@ ds with the explosion of community service programs .
we may be at the top of the list when it comes to influenc@@ ing access to personal wealth .
in the language of my students , &quot; deep thought matters when you &apos;re contem@@ pl@@ ating what to do about things that matter . &quot;
we inten@@ d to turn the intellectual and imagin@@ ative power , passion and bol@@ dness of our students , fac@@ ul@@ ty and staff to developing strate@@ gies for acting on the critical challenges of our time .
and i &apos;m at a stage in life where i &apos;m year@@ ning for my old days , so i want to conf@@ ess to you that when i was a kid , indeed , i was a conserv@@ ative .
and i &apos;m not talking about the god thing .
okay , so juli@@ an made this video .
j@@ s : one re@@ mix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience .
but appar@@ ently , no brains exis@@ ted in this place when democr@@ ats passed and sig@@ ned this bill into law .
these tools that we built en@@ able this sharing in parts through licen@@ ses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requ@@ ir@@ ing permission first because the permission has already been gran@@ ted and a respect for the cre@@ ator because it buil@@ ds upon a copyright the cre@@ ator has licen@@ sed fre@@ ely .
it is an extraordinary per@@ version of the system of freedom we should be encour@@ aging .
everything is covered in invisible eco@@ systems made of tiny life@@ forms : bacteria , viruses and fun@@ g@@ i .
but if you look across these space types , you can see that they &apos;re fundament@@ ally different from one another .
he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health .
in fact , they make their li@@ v@@ ings on this kind of stuff . i &apos;m going to try and save you all the time and all the money and go through it in the next three minutes , so bear with me .
the idea was , &quot; vote your conscience , &quot; vote for mis@@ ter s@@ plas@@ hy p@@ ants .
it &apos;s okay to take yourself a little less seriously , given that , even though it &apos;s a very serious cause , you could ultimately achieve your final goal .
a computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
but sp@@ in on to the 8@@ 0s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
in the next couple of years , the hyper@@ text community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
like this . and let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
voice : and who are these ? m@@ t : ah , mis@@ chi@@ e@@ f-@@ makers . watch .
thank you .
now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of china ?
i &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
india , the united states , in@@ don@@ es@@ ia , braz@@ il -- all of them are multi@@ rac@@ ial .
so you can see that the way in which power has been construc@@ ted in china is very different from our experience in western history .
unfortunately , i think , i have to say that i think attitude towards china is that of a kind of little wes@@ ter@@ ner ment@@ ality .
i would w@@ ager it was probably about 200 years ago .
but i want to argue , above all , a big@@ -@@ picture positive for this world .
so that all past , present and future gen@@ res can be studied and abstr@@ acted , live .
inside your heart a voice is calling .
thank you .
she said , &quot; don &apos;t say that , &quot; but i &apos;m saying it anyway .
he said , &quot; oh , so am i@@ . &quot;
so , i tried going to the art store .
i said , i &apos;m going to collabor@@ ate with anybody and everybody i meet .
i have to travel seven oceans , and i have to come and see you .
150 artists volunte@@ ered to help me with my we@@ d@@ ding .
i was very up@@ set .
i moved back to new york , my work has changed .
i hope you will join me in this magic car@@ pet ride , and touch children and be honest .
there is the a@@ chil@@ les &apos; he@@ el of growing ine@@ quality --
increasingly , over time , this will be possible from our own skin -- able to repli@@ cate parts of the body .
small levels of stoc@@ k push res@@ ili@@ ence into other people &apos;s responsibility .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and last is that we &apos;re more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before -- except for if you &apos;re sitting next to someone .
they made sure that the dem@@ ographic for who they were t@@ arg@@ eting and the car was all mat@@ ching .
they &apos;re both pe@@ er-@@ to-@@ pe@@ er car@@ -@@ sharing services , because the two things that really work for car@@ -@@ sharing is , one , the car has to be available , and two , it &apos;s within one or two blocks of where you stand .
i look at things as plat@@ forms .
there &apos;s a po@@ p@@ -up general store every three weeks , and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for fo@@ o@@ dies .
i have a website -- it &apos;s a direc@@ tory -- and it started with about 1,@@ 200 companies , and in the last two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half months it &apos;s up to about 3@@ ,@@ 300 companies .
what about art ?
i mean , these kids , without control , thro@@ wing mol@@ ot@@ o@@ v cock@@ tail@@ s , att@@ acking the cop@@ s and the fi@@ rem@@ en , lo@@ oting everything they could in the sh@@ ops .
asked them to make a face as a sign of commit@@ ment .
and then there was always a silence .
most of the places i went to , i decided to go there because i &apos;ve heard about it through the media .
after that day , everyone in the fav@@ ela gave me the green light .
they kept asking me , &quot; what is the purpose of your project ?
when you look at ki@@ ber@@ a now , they look back .
because that &apos;s a big part of it . there &apos;s lay@@ ers behind each photo .
they asked me , &quot; please , make our story travel with you . &quot;
or , &quot; how can we help ? &quot;
e : hi , s@@ wee@@ the@@ art .
now , einstein also thinks , you know , working in c@@ aves and trav@@ elling through space -- it &apos;s all very dangerous jobs .
e : what &apos;s the matter ?
e : happy birth@@ day to you .
sw : at the zo@@ o we have big c@@ ats from the jun@@ gle .
i would run into the living room , jump up on the cou@@ ch , ri@@ p the cus@@ hi@@ ons off , throw them on the floor , scre@@ am at the top of my lun@@ gs and run out
and the tur@@ n@@ around in swimming came when a friend of mine said , &quot; i will go a year without any stimul@@ ants &quot; -- this is a si@@ x-@@ doub@@ le-@@ espr@@ ess@@ o-@@ per@@ -@@ day type of guy -- &quot; if you can complete a one kilom@@ eter open water race . &quot;
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s really all you need to know .
the other 4@@ ,@@ 9@@ 99 students in the school , who were japanese , bes@@ ides the american .
i looked a lot like an or@@ angu@@ tan , our close cous@@ ins , or the incredible hu@@ l@@ k . not very good for ball@@ room d@@ ancing .
now the prot@@ ec@@ tion@@ ism of arg@@ ent@@ ine dance teachers a@@ side , i found this very interesting . so i decided to focus on three of those com@@ mon@@ alities .
there are many different types .
it &apos;s an idea for a new kind of school , which turns on its head much of our conventi@@ onal thinking about what schools are for and how they work .
and the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of prepar@@ ing children much better for re@@ al-@@ life work today .
i &apos;m going to start with a little story .
there &apos;s more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain .
and fortunately , in the course of this project , the trans@@ plant surge@@ ons and the other people decided , forget common practice . we have to switch .
well , one thing that animals seem to do is , they eat po@@ o -- co@@ proph@@ ag@@ ia .
it doesn &apos;t mean that it aff@@ ects every part of us , but it might .
and i &apos;m going to tell you what the cost of wikipedia is , but first i &apos;ll show you how big it is .
so we &apos;re doing around 1.@@ 4 billion page vie@@ ws mon@@ th@@ ly , so it &apos;s really gotten to be a huge thing .
and no side of the political spectrum has a mono@@ po@@ ly on either of those quali@@ ties .
this is really important , because a lot of new pages that get created are just gar@@ b@@ age that have to be del@@ et@@ ed , you know , as@@ d@@ fas@@ d@@ f .
so , i mentioned earlier , people type as@@ d@@ fas@@ d@@ f -- it needs to be del@@ et@@ ed . cases like that , the administr@@ ators just del@@ e@@ te it .
so how &apos;s all this govern@@ ed ?
but they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly ab@@ sur@@ d way to del@@ e@@ te a perfectly val@@ id article .
and we actually have a project that i &apos;m personally really excited about , which is the wi@@ ki books project , which is an effort to create t@@ ext@@ books in all the languages .
and as the sun sets behind her temp@@ le in the after@@ noon , it perfectly ba@@ thes his temp@@ le with her sh@@ ado@@ w .
my body is num@@ b with gri@@ ef .
wild is love .
fore@@ most , i have come to think that roman@@ tic love is a drive , a basic mat@@ ing drive .
in fact , i think animal attr@@ action can be instant -- you can see an ele@@ phant inst@@ antly go for another ele@@ phant .
i think we &apos;ve evolved four very bro@@ ad person@@ ality types associated with the rati@@ os of these four chemicals in the brain .
and i &apos;m going to play some son@@ gs for you ton@@ ight that are , literally , world premi@@ er@@ es .
y@@ ves ro@@ ss@@ y : fly with the jet@@ man
ladies and gentlemen , an histor@@ ic flight has beg@@ un .
you are just in the el@@ ement .
so you have to adap@@ t .
b@@ g : we saw the 2009 cross@@ ing of the gi@@ br@@ al@@ tar str@@ ait where you lost control and then you di@@ ved down into the clou@@ ds and in the ocean .
we have a hundred years of experience .
y@@ r : and also the curr@@ ents are quite funny there .
&lt; transcript &gt;
now , what had changed ?
and the un@@ seen , you have to admit , doesn &apos;t come to us through the sen@@ ses .
it &apos;s like all knowledge . it &apos;s con@@ j@@ ec@@ tural , gu@@ ess@@ work , tes@@ ted by observation , not der@@ ived from it .
that accoun@@ ts for the same phenomen@@ a as the original my@@ th .
but the more important one is explan@@ ation@@ less the@@ ories .
this is the rati@@ o of op@@ tom@@ e@@ tr@@ ists to people in sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa .
the technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down .
and that &apos;s where i became truly obs@@ essed with this po@@ lar re@@ al@@ m .
thank you very much . i appreci@@ ate it .
here &apos;s a mother and her two year-old cu@@ b were traveling on a ship a hundred miles off@@ sho@@ re in the middle of no@@ where , and they &apos;re ri@@ ding on this big piece of gl@@ acier ice , which is great for them ; they &apos;re safe at this point .
this is after an hour under the ice .
even though that spirit bear moment was powerful , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever have another experience like i did with these le@@ opar@@ d se@@ als .
after five days of cross@@ ing the dra@@ ke passage , we have finally arrived at ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca .
so she did this threat display for a few minutes , and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally rela@@ x@@ ed .
and she would get frustr@@ ated ; she &apos;d b@@ low bu@@ b@@ bles in my face .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
when i &apos;m jo@@ king , i try and explain it happened at mid@@ night , you see , while we were as@@ le@@ ep , but it was mid@@ night 15 years ago . okay ?
he wis@@ ely explains this to us . he says design thinking must t@@ ack@@ le big systems for the challenges we have .
what he did was , he got a transparent pi@@ pe — have you seen this demonstr@@ ation before ? — he atta@@ ched it to a ta@@ p . so effectively what you had was , you had a situation where — i &apos;ll try and draw the ta@@ p and the pi@@ pe , actually i &apos;ll ski@@ p the ta@@ p . the tap@@ s are hard .
if you work in an institution , one day you will get them to make that decision .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
this is from some guy named ted .
let &apos;s study some moral psychology and see where it takes us .
it &apos;s only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to co@@ operate , join together into groups , but in this case , groups that are united to fight other groups .
on the left , i &apos;ve pl@@ ot@@ ted the s@@ cor@@ es for liber@@ als ; on the right , those for conserv@@ atives ; in the middle , the moder@@ ates .
because liber@@ als like to say , &quot; f@@ et@@ ch , please . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to be a suc@@ ker . i &apos;m not going to co@@ operate . &quot;
but it really helps to organiz@@ e a group if you can have sub-@@ groups , and if those sub-@@ groups have some intern@@ al structure , and if you have some ide@@ ology that tells people to sup@@ press their car@@ n@@ ality , to pur@@ sue higher , no@@ bl@@ er ends .
you find the same thing in h@@ indu@@ ism .
step out of the moral ma@@ tri@@ x , just try to see it as a struggle playing out , in which everybody does think they &apos;re right , and everybody , at least , has some reasons -- even if you dis@@ agree with them -- everybody has some reasons for what they &apos;re doing .
but they aren &apos;t trained in the same way that police off@@ ic@@ ers are and they &apos;re certainly not equi@@ pped in the same way police off@@ ic@@ ers are .
you &apos;ve got non-@@ le@@ thal sh@@ ot@@ g@@ un r@@ ounds that cont@@ ain ru@@ b@@ ber p@@ ell@@ ets instead of the traditional metal ones .
so i actually started to investi@@ gate some of those issues and have a look at the way that police use non-@@ le@@ thal weapons when they &apos;re introduced and some of the problems that might ar@@ ise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them .
anyone want to take a st@@ ab at the number of times , given how they &apos;ve introduced this , the number of times police in que@@ en@@ s@@ land used o@@ .@@ c. spr@@ ay in that period ?
it was used in@@ dis@@ crimin@@ ately .
she wasn &apos;t violent .
they &apos;re trained to be more res@@ trained in the use of force than the military are .
it &apos;s a scr@@ aper bi@@ ke ; it &apos;s called -- from o@@ ak@@ land .
people are re@@ making things into fashion .
makers today , to some degree , are out on the edge .
and then he didn &apos;t particularly like school that much , but he got involved in robo@@ tics competi@@ tions , and he realized he had a talent , and , more importantly , he had a real passion for it .
now that could be a dog door , it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn &apos;t ,
think how much money and how many years it took nasa to get satellites into space .
this is the least gl@@ amor@@ ous magazine on the new@@ s@@ stand -- it &apos;s all about sex ti@@ ps .
but still , glamour is an illusion .
when you st@@ ack people in ro@@ ws , the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the fore@@ ground --
and yet you will see in religious art , sa@@ ints or the vir@@ gin mary will often be por@@ tr@@ ayed -- not always -- in gl@@ amor@@ ous forms .
you don &apos;t think about how nic@@ ole kid@@ man is man@@ eu@@ vering that dress -- she just looks completely natural .
it inv@@ ites us into the world but it doesn &apos;t give us a completely clear picture .
&quot; the ma@@ tri@@ x &quot; is a movie that is all about glamour .
and here &apos;s he@@ dy lam@@ ar@@ r .
that means we all share a common ancest@@ or , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
so here , we have a young female and a male engag@@ ed in a cha@@ se game .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so i &apos;m going to tell you three things about this today .
and he says , &quot; y@@ um y@@ um y@@ um y@@ um y@@ um !
rs : and iv@@ an says , &quot; i want my che@@ ese sandwich . &quot;
rs : was iv@@ an being mean and n@@ au@@ gh@@ ty for taking jo@@ shu@@ a &apos;s sandwich ?
and she puts it in her friend &apos;s coffee .
so i &apos;m going to show you a dem@@ o of this .
chris anderson : so , i have a question . when you start talking about using mag@@ netic pul@@ ses to change people &apos;s moral jud@@ g@@ ments , that sounds al@@ arm@@ ing .
we knew how brains see , and how they control the body and how they hear and sense .
it was a way of keeping my head atta@@ ched .
i heard people mur@@ mur from time to time that i should love my body , so i learned how to do this .
and many of the women had holes in their bodies -- holes , fis@@ tu@@ la -- that were the viol@@ ation of war -- holes in the fabri@@ c of their sou@@ ls .
and in the name of connec@@ ted@@ ness , the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her bel@@ o@@ ved gulf of mexico .
it was under@@ paid and really lo@@ ving nur@@ ses .
no , we speed them up , don &apos;t we ? so we used to di@@ al ; now we speed di@@ al .
am i really in such a hur@@ ry that i &apos;m prepared to fo@@ b off my son with a sound by@@ te at the end of the day ? &quot;
and than@@ k@@ fully , the answer is yes , because what i discovered , when i began looking around , that there is a global back@@ l@@ ash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better , and that bu@@ sier is best .
so , you know , even sex is on a stop@@ watch these days .
and even if they sometimes do nothing at all .
or even simply just taking the time to slow down and sav@@ or your life .
and we &apos;ll go off and have a conversation on that .
this used to be an island -- ack@@ er@@ man island -- and we filled in the channel during the depression to create jobs . &quot;
there &apos;s an an@@ ter@@ o@@ om with photographs of children who per@@ ished and then you come into a large space .
and i re@@ comm@@ ended they do it right there , on that hill and this hill , and bridge all the way into the town .
and at night , just one line of light cu@@ ts through the mountain , which is a sky@@ light on top of that tri@@ angle .
i &apos;d like to conclu@@ de by saying something ... i &apos;d like to conclu@@ de by rel@@ ating all of what i &apos;ve said to the term &quot; beauty . &quot;
because it has provo@@ ked , and does provo@@ ke , a vis@@ cer@@ al anxi@@ ety in the bel@@ lies of many a western sou@@ l , especially when vie@@ wed through the mono@@ chr@@ om@@ atic l@@ ens of tur@@ bul@@ ence and tur@@ mo@@ il .
a ris@@ ing ti@@ de lif@@ ts all bo@@ ats .
i won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
see , these all lie right inside of this general emotional pal@@ ette that we were painting .
well we &apos;re jazz musici@@ ans , so ster@@ e@@ oty@@ pically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and the way it works is , it comes from the sou@@ th@@ west .
so it &apos;s essentially a fres@@ h@@ water animal .
something like this , these are all this species globe sk@@ im@@ mer .
so , why is it that every year millions of drag@@ on@@ flies , millions , millions of drag@@ on@@ flies turn up ?
so , next thing i did is i got on the phone .
octo@@ ber , nov@@ ember , dec@@ ember . that is not the nor@@ the@@ ast mon@@ soon seas@@ on .
and i know because when you look at the rain@@ fall , these particular insects , these globe sk@@ imm@@ ers bre@@ ed in tempor@@ ary rain water po@@ ols .
just last week the ra@@ ins broke . the short ra@@ ins broke
a quite incredible fe@@ at .
they have the most incredible journey , but several make the cross@@ ing from india to africa . inclu@@ des this one , the ho@@ bby .
mal@@ col@@ m gl@@ ad@@ well : the strange tale of the nor@@ den bomb@@ sight
it &apos;s a complicated physics problem .
he was simple the instrument of god &apos;s will .
well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get shot down .
if you go into the military , you &apos;ll find lots of car@@ l nor@@ d@@ ens as well .
well it &apos;s extraordinary .
why build a virtual world ? phili@@ p ro@@ se@@ d@@ ale talks about the virtual society he foun@@ ded , second life , and its under@@ pin@@ n@@ ings in human creativity . it &apos;s a place so different that anything could happen .
i also think that more generally , the use of the internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general tr@@ end .
we always play a game at the office where you can take any article and find the same article where you just re@@ place the words &quot; second life &quot; with &quot; web , &quot; and &quot; virtual reality &quot; with &quot; internet . &quot;
the web puts information in the form of text and images .
so i think that &apos;s another big point .
we finally gave up , took it out of the code .
jh : questions for phili@@ p ro@@ se@@ d@@ ale ? right here .
65 percent of the users are not in the united states .
p@@ r : if you count , yeah , cities . so -- but i did -- and i didn &apos;t do -- i think i didn &apos;t do as well in school as i could have . i think you &apos;re right .
what is happiness , and how can we all get some ? bio@@ chem@@ ist turned bu@@ ddhis@@ t mon@@ k mat@@ th@@ i@@ eu ri@@ card says we can train our minds in hab@@ its of well-@@ being , to generate a true sense of ser@@ en@@ ity and ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment .
it &apos;s about two meters by three , and you are all wel@@ come any time .
like , you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot .
and also , when things go wrong , we try to fix the outside so much , but our control of the ou@@ ter world is limited , tempor@@ ary , and often , ill@@ us@@ ory .
is change possible in our emotions , in our traits , in our mo@@ ods ?
so then , it &apos;s a self-@@ per@@ pet@@ u@@ ating process .
this is the place where the me@@ dit@@ ators -- you can see it &apos;s kind of inspir@@ ing .
some me@@ dit@@ ators , without trying to stop it , but simply by being completely open , thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a sho@@ oting star , they are able not to move at all .
all humans share some common bits of dna , passed down to us from our african ancest@@ ors . gene@@ tic@@ ist s@@ pen@@ cer wel@@ ls talks about how his gen@@ ographic project will use this shared dna to figure out how we are -- in all our diversity -- truly connected .
and the second question is related , but slightly different .
the field of pal@@ e@@ o@@ anthropo@@ logy , i &apos;ll argue , gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our anc@@ es@@ try , but it doesn &apos;t give us the prob@@ abilities that we really want as scientists .
instead of going out and gu@@ essing about our anc@@ es@@ try , di@@ gg@@ ing things up out of the ground , possible ancest@@ ors , and saying it on the basis of mor@@ pho@@ logy -- which we still don &apos;t completely understand ,
a ha@@ plo@@ id genome -- we actually have two cop@@ ies of all of our chromosom@@ es --
now , even though these are simpli@@ fied ver@@ sions of the real trees , they &apos;re still kind of complicated , so let &apos;s sim@@ p@@ lif@@ y them .
why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently ?
we nearly went ext@@ inct . we were hang@@ ing on by our fin@@ ger@@ n@@ ails .
so those of you who are going on one of the post-@@ conference tours , you &apos;ll get to see what a real sav@@ ann@@ ah is like .
hundreds of thousands of dna sam@@ ples from people all over the world . &quot;
so how are we doing on the project ? we &apos;ve got about 2@@ 5,000 sam@@ ples coll@@ ected from indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
eric be@@ in@@ ho@@ ck@@ er estimat@@ es that in new york city alone , there are some 10 billion sk@@ us , or dist@@ inct com@@ modi@@ ties , being tr@@ aded .
the universe is tiny ; it &apos;s smaller than an at@@ om .
and the universe is now signific@@ antly more interesting and more complex .
you also need a great diversity of chemical elements , and you need liquid such as water .
so dna &apos;s learning and it &apos;s building greater diversity and greater complexity .
it &apos;s what makes us different .
so what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and frag@@ ilit@@ y and the d@@ ang@@ ers that face us , but it can also show us our power with collective learning .
these lo@@ sses , they feel , emo@@ tion@@ ally , they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up . &quot; so we &apos;re probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking .
how do we take an understanding of the money mistakes people make , and then turning the behavi@@ oral challenges into behavi@@ oral solutions ?
what are we going to do about it ?
let me now talk about another behavi@@ oral obstac@@ le to saving having to do with in@@ er@@ ti@@ a .
therefore , 99 percent of people are organ don@@ ors .
whether you think about immedi@@ ate grati@@ fication , and the chocol@@ ates versus ban@@ an@@ as , it &apos;s just pa@@ in@@ ful to save now .
saving more today is not an option .
we &apos;ve got a lot to do , a lot to solve , also in the reti@@ rement area when it comes to what people do with their money after reti@@ rement .
we &apos;ve only done two shows in 2007 so far , but our first show was actually the col@@ dest performance we &apos;ve ever had .
this is ele@@ an@@ or ro@@ os@@ ev@@ el@@ t .
so , i was just asked to go and shoot this film called &quot; el@@ iz@@ ab@@ eth . &quot;
you know , simple words lost in the quic@@ k@@ sand of experience .
so what do you do ?
and he said , &quot; son , it goes on forever . &quot;
we tell our stories , and a person without a story does not exist .
so when i work with ra@@ h@@ man who &apos;s a great musici@@ an , i often tell him , &quot; don &apos;t follow what the s@@ cript already says .
of course , when i asked cate blan@@ ch@@ et@@ t , i said , &quot; what &apos;s the film about ? &quot;
is it his ?
the camera &apos;s looking down at her because she &apos;s in the well .
they started to build fl@@ yo@@ vers to get from a to b faster , but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth .
all contradi@@ ctions of his notes suggest the harmon@@ y .
gave it more love and care than my own child .
that &apos;s not by chance , that &apos;s by design .
it &apos;s the pur@@ est form of cin@@ em@@ atic story@@ telling .
she believed that all well-@@ dra@@ wn characters have a sp@@ ine .
and i finally came across this fantastic quote by a british play@@ wright , willi@@ am ar@@ cher : &quot; dr@@ ama is antici@@ pation min@@ gl@@ ed with un@@ certa@@ int@@ y . &quot; it &apos;s an incredibly insi@@ ght@@ ful definition .
and we had nai@@ vely thought , well woo@@ dy in &quot; to@@ y story &quot; has to become sel@@ fl@@ ess at the end , so you &apos;ve got to start from some@@ place .
i couldn &apos;t get enough of it .
and that &apos;s what i think the magic ingre@@ di@@ ent is , the secret sauce , is can you in@@ vo@@ ke wonder .
it doesn &apos;t always mean plo@@ t or fact .
and i got really good at predic@@ ting how many body bag@@ s you would need for the people who were going to die in these cam@@ ps .
and the people who made money from braz@@ il nu@@ ts were not the people who made money from cutting the for@@ ests .
for ban@@ kers , we &apos;d be living off the principal , not the interest .
we need to use less to make more .
we need car@@ g@@ ill to work with bun@@ ge .
if we work with those , if we change those companies and the way they do business , then the rest will happen automati@@ cally .
it &apos;s not all fun and games .
why is car@@ g@@ ill important ?
that is an ex@@ tern@@ ality by definition .
the special relationship between the united states and the u.k. is based not only on the relationship between governments , but the common language and the values that we share ,
and my mother , the most important role model in my life , who lives with us at the white house and helps to care for our two little dau@@ gh@@ ters , mal@@ ia and s@@ ash@@ a .
and i think about that today because i am re@@ min@@ ded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of clo@@ sing that gap .
i thought being smart was co@@ ol@@ er than anything in the world .
because the world is big .
so i closed my eyes , i took breath and the first thing that came up and out was &quot; sum@@ mer@@ time , &quot; por@@ g@@ y and b@@ ess .
jon@@ athan z@@ it@@ train : the web as random acts of kin@@ dness
they had none of that .
now , of course , in a mo@@ sh p@@ it it &apos;s hard to speci@@ fy a destin@@ ation .
then , at moment number two , you have the fa@@ ke announ@@ cement go out .
j@@ im@@ bo &apos;s idea was for nu@@ pedia .
not because it &apos;s a job , not because it &apos;s a career , but because it &apos;s a calling .
we see it on blogs all over the place .
in fact , talk about technology im@@ it@@ ating life im@@ it@@ ating tech , or maybe it &apos;s the other way around . an n@@ y@@ u resear@@ cher here took little car@@ d@@ board robots with sm@@ il@@ ey faces on them , and a motor that just dro@@ ve them forward and a fla@@ g sti@@ cking out the back with a des@@ i@@ red destin@@ ation .
what it &apos;s saying to you is what we heard yesterday , dem@@ os@@ th@@ en@@ es was saying to us .
the auth@@ ori@@ ties did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could ta@@ x people and make more money for to run their business .
and i walked 10 miles or so , all morning , to get there , to the medicine man .
and if 5,000 dollars every year -- so that &apos;s 50,000 dollars .
so if the tele@@ phone is a production tool , then we don &apos;t quite have to worry about the pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ing power .
so what happens is that somebody bor@@ ro@@ ws money from the bank .
and of course , it &apos;s very bene@@ fici@@ al in a lot of ways .
and this is a new project i have with d@@ ean k@@ am@@ en , the famous invent@@ or in america .
and i realized that perhaps the western world will not continue to domin@@ ate the world forever .
and 18@@ 5@@ 8 in japan was the year when japan had to sign the h@@ arr@@ is treat@@ y and accept trade on favor@@ able condition for the u.@@ s .
united king@@ dom , united states .
but they went up here , and india was trying to follow .
ut@@ tar pr@@ ad@@ esh , the biggest of the states here , is poor@@ er and has a lower health than the rest of india .
and we shall see what will happen with these countries .
i consider really the big obstac@@ le because to bring the entire population into growth and pros@@ per@@ ity is what will create a domes@@ tic market , what will avoid social inst@@ ability , and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population .
because , as i &apos;ll explain to you , the questions on the small@@ est and the largest scale are actually very connected .
so we see the galaxy and fix@@ ate on that , but it &apos;s actually a cloud of dark matter that &apos;s domin@@ ating the structure and the dynam@@ ics of this galaxy .
now , suppose i put in the middle a clu@@ ster of galaxies -- and don &apos;t forget the dark matter , ok .
but igno@@ re the top part .
and that is the dark matter in which the clu@@ ster is em@@ be@@ dded , ok .
the star@@ t@@ ling answer to this question , ok , from these experiments , was that space is exp@@ anding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , ok .
i mean that we have mathemati@@ cally consist@@ ent the@@ ories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon , ok , things that i haven &apos;t even talked about , that each predict the existence of a very wea@@ kly inter@@ acting , new parti@@ cle .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and that job is that they go around and pick up sy@@ r@@ ing@@ es from the back of hospit@@ als , was@@ h them , and in the course of this , obviously pic@@ king them up they inju@@ re themselves .
and in compar@@ is@@ on , a coca@@ -@@ co@@ la is 10 times the price .
imagine , and if you haven &apos;t done this in a while , do .
it was so architec@@ tural . it was so pre@@ cise .
how does nature repe@@ l bacteria ?
and now kin@@ e@@ tic and architec@@ tural fir@@ ms like gri@@ m@@ sha@@ w are starting to look at this as a way of co@@ ating buildings so that they ga@@ ther water from the fo@@ g .
every red blood cell of your body right now has these h@@ our@@ gl@@ ass@@ -@@ shaped por@@ es called a@@ qua@@ por@@ ins .
em@@ be@@ d@@ ding nan@@ o@@ particles in a material for instance , always .
mit just has a new radio chi@@ p that uses far less power than our chi@@ ps .
and that information will go into as@@ k@@ natu@@ re@@ .@@ or@@ g .
but this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic .
every time you have a car@@ ro@@ t instead of a co@@ ok@@ ie , every time you go to the gy@@ m instead of going to the movies , that &apos;s a co@@ stly investment in your health .
but it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before .
in kenya , in z@@ ambi@@ a , and a bunch of countries , there &apos;s been testing in random sam@@ ples of the population .
but it does suggest that that number might be a little big .
even though it is the case that poverty is linked to aids , in the sense that africa is poor and they have a lot of aids , it &apos;s not necessarily the case that impro@@ ving poverty -- at least in the short run , that impro@@ ving ex@@ ports and impro@@ ving development -- to a decline in hiv pre@@ val@@ ence .
there are more things that i think that i want to do .
what motiv@@ ated me to film their behavior was something that i asked my scientific ad@@ vis@@ ers : &quot; what motiv@@ ates the pollin@@ ators ? &quot;
i &apos;m a product of this visi@@ onary mother and father .
and the second thing , which has st@@ ayed with me , which became my philosophy of life , which made all the difference , is : 100 things happen in your life , good or bad .
so this was how it came into my service , and it was different from the men .
i said , &quot; do you pr@@ ay ? &quot;
secon@@ dly , this concept .
secon@@ dly is about the anti-@@ corruption movement in india .
this of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
amaz@@ on , now with the kin@@ d@@ le , is trying to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze books .
so every time you buy tick@@ ets on tick@@ et@@ master , you help to di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book .
then of course , you fill out the cap@@ t@@ cha because you help us di@@ gi@@ ti@@ ze a book .
it started with me pos@@ ing a question to my graduate student , sever@@ in hack@@ er .
this person starts apo@@ logi@@ zing for the fact that it &apos;s transl@@ ated with a computer .
the other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
we &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
now the thing that i &apos;m most excited about with du@@ ol@@ in@@ go is i think this provi@@ des a fair business model for language education .
now , a decade later , it &apos;s really time to push the envelop@@ e a little bit ,
this is all happening with exc@@ ess capacity .
it took me a year and a half to get the insur@@ ance just right .
cool guys , excited guys , and here is sel@@ ma , who -- i love this driver .
mat@@ t kill@@ ing@@ s@@ worth : want to be happ@@ ier ? stay in the moment
and it &apos;s not just a lot of people , it &apos;s a really di@@ verse group , people from a wide range of ages , from 18 to late 8@@ 0s , a wide range of in@@ comes , education levels , people who are married , div@@ or@@ ced , wi@@ do@@ wed , etc .
it &apos;s one of their least enjo@@ y@@ able acti@@ vities , and yet they are subst@@ anti@@ ally happ@@ ier when they &apos;re focused only on their comm@@ ute than when their mind is going off to something else .
my hope is that over time , by trac@@ king people &apos;s moment-@@ to-@@ moment happiness and their experiences in daily life , we &apos;ll be able to un@@ cover a lot of important causes of happiness , and then in the end , a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that &apos;s not only ri@@ cher and health@@ ier , but happ@@ ier as well .
so here i was in 2008 wondering where i was in my life .
and i asked one of the vot@@ ers , i said , &quot; whom are you going to vote for ? &quot;
after all , they decide , and they did .
and yes , we afri@@ cans can .
so a few months later , in 2008 , one of our scientists built on that research . he took skin bi@@ op@@ si@@ es , this time from people who had a disease , als , or as you call it in the u.k. , motor neur@@ on disease .
so we really have to change this .
bio@@ chem@@ ist k@@ ary mul@@ l@@ is talks about the basis of modern science : the experiment . sharing tal@@ es from the 17@@ th century and from his own back@@ y@@ ar@@ d-@@ ro@@ c@@ ke@@ try days , mul@@ l@@ is celebr@@ ates the curios@@ ity , inspiration and ri@@ g@@ or of good science in all its forms .
and the english set up cr@@ om@@ well and a whole bunch of re@@ publi@@ cans or whatever , and not the kind of re@@ publi@@ cans we had .
so therefore the church said that you can &apos;t make a vac@@ u@@ um , you know .
and god was out of the picture .
remember , that &apos;s a short time .
and i knew that fro@@ gs -- little fro@@ gs -- had aspir@@ ations of space travel , just like people . and i -- i was looking for a -- a propul@@ sion system that would like , make a ro@@ cket , like , maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles .
and then it co@@ ol@@ ed down to a bri@@ ck@@ -@@ hard substance , that when you lit that , it went off like a b@@ at .
because the results of it were so spectac@@ ular that if it worked it was going to change everybody &apos;s go@@ dd@@ am@@ n way of doing molecular biology .
and they weren &apos;t the curious little boys that liked to put fro@@ gs up in the air .
but in fact , it was just coming up -- it was the ni@@ ght@@ time ; the day@@ time temper@@ atures didn &apos;t go up .
there isn &apos;t a problem with global warming any longer , so we can -- you know , they &apos;re fun@@ ding .
so , eventually i decided to pur@@ sue an m@@ f@@ a instead of an m@@ .@@ d .
and , in a way , i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature .
one thing that stru@@ ck me , after this inci@@ dent , was that a space like that holds so many del@@ et@@ ed mem@@ ories of the city .
they were consist@@ ently du@@ g as li@@ mes@@ t@@ one qu@@ arri@@ es and by the 18@@ th century , the c@@ av@@ ing@@ -@@ in of some of these qu@@ arri@@ es posed safety thre@@ ats , so the government or@@ der@@ ed re@@ in@@ forc@@ ing of the exis@@ ting qu@@ arri@@ es and du@@ g new observation tun@@ n@@ els in order to monit@@ or and map the whole place .
and this is the first theater project i worked on .
and you can sort of scri@@ bble it , if you like --
and that &apos;s no different from im@@ peri@@ al college in london , by the way , it &apos;s not some sort of anti-@@ american thing going on .
and this is nasa &apos;s view . they &apos;re stun@@ n@@ ingly similar .
so we &apos;re not empty v@@ ess@@ els ; the mental models that we have as children pers@@ ist into adul@@ tho@@ od .
so this is a start .
now if we answer those questions in reverse order , the third question -- is matter evol@@ v@@ able ? --
let &apos;s say that if the physics of fusion is en@@ co@@ ded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well .
but what else is life character@@ ized by ?
so we have some kind of prim@@ or@@ di@@ al sou@@ p .
so what we &apos;re going to try and do is come up with an in@@ organic le@@ go k@@ it of molecules .
is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to com@@ pe@@ te ?
so what will that tell us about the orig@@ in of life and the meaning of life ?
&lt; transcript &gt;
what is the orig@@ in of the data ?
it was so trag@@ ic .
there was res@@ istance for the old malaria drugs , until we got the new drugs .
i give you congo , which was high , ghana -- lower . and kenya -- even lower .
we never had a war ; swe@@ den was in peace all this time .
we have a sev@@ ere problem in countries which are at a stand@@ still .
and we get a lot a new neighbors .
and we have to realize that we are all going to into this , down to here .
all the time we are trying to get value for money .
i strugg@@ led to &#91; un@@ clear &#93; day was a huge issue .
can you believe it ?
and therefore , each compon@@ ent had to have a du@@ al functi@@ on@@ ality .
here is an american citiz@@ en and his son having an artificial foot .
&quot; no ... not at all . &quot;
time for development -- it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars .
and he also said , &quot; i would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all . &quot; so he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people , not just a few people .
and by whom ?
but it was a poor school with rich teachers , hon@@ est@@ ly .
that was the lesson . that was the inspir@@ ational moment .
then you can &apos;t help but make them go &quot; wow &quot; ; you can &apos;t help but turn it into a mem@@ or@@ able event -- you can &apos;t help but turn it into an experience .
even if you go for a walk in the pro@@ ver@@ bi@@ al wo@@ ods , there is a company that manufactu@@ red the car that deli@@ vered you to the edge of the wo@@ ods ; there &apos;s a company that manufactu@@ red the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the wo@@ ods .
are you rend@@ ering authenti@@ city ?
universal city walk is a real fa@@ ke -- in fact , we got this very term from ada lou@@ ise hu@@ x@@ table &apos;s book , &quot; the un@@ real america . &quot; a wonderful book , where she talks about universal city walk as -- you know , she dec@@ ries the fa@@ ke , but she says , at least that &apos;s a real fa@@ ke , right , because you can see behind the fac@@ ade , right ?
right , the t &amp; amp ; a network . then it bought mi@@ ra@@ ma@@ x , known for its n@@ c@@ -@@ 17 f@@ are , and all of a sudden , families everywhere couldn &apos;t really trust what they were getting from dis@@ ney .
but surr@@ ound the bre@@ wing of that coffee with the ambi@@ ance of a star@@ bu@@ cks , with the authenti@@ c ce@@ d@@ ar that goes inside of there , and now , because of that authenti@@ c experience , you can charge two , three , four , five dollars for a cu@@ p of coffee .
and this is one that i did , probably like when i was around sev@@ ent@@ h grade , and i remember when i was doing this , i was thinking about that little rock there , and the path@@ way of the vehic@@ les as they would fly through the air , and how the characters -- -- would come sho@@ oting out of the car , so , on my mind , i was thinking about the traj@@ ect@@ ory of the vehic@@ les .
and that &apos;s a little found object .
because it could run all the time .
it completely changed what i could do .
so i &apos;ll just let this chair come down .
if the f@@ et@@ us contin@@ ues to grow at this speed for the entire nine months , it would be 1.@@ 5 tons at birth .
the complexity of building that within a single system is , again , beyond any com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sion or any exis@@ ting mathematics today .
but we are crazy . we do these things .
and if you have a liquid hot mass , it will produce something which we call a continu@@ ous spectrum .
it &apos;s a heavy el@@ ement produced in ther@@ mon@@ u@@ clear explo@@ sions of super@@ nov@@ a@@ e .
it &apos;s one of the myster@@ ies we still have , super f@@ lar@@ es .
coming back to the most important question , &quot; is there anybody out there ? &quot;
now very recently , very recently , i &apos;m talking about last six , seven , eight months , water , meth@@ ane , carbon di@@ oxide have been det@@ ected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system .
it will take about five years .
and this is where my story starts .
and when you ask people about connection , the stories they told me were about dis@@ connection .
i wrote a book , i published a theory , but something was not okay -- and what it was is that , if i roughly took the people i intervie@@ wed and divi@@ ded them into people who really have a sense of wor@@ thin@@ ess -- that &apos;s what this comes down to , a sense of wor@@ thin@@ ess -- they have a strong sense of love and bel@@ ong@@ ing -- and folks who struggle for it , and folks who are always wondering if they &apos;re good enough .
the other thing that they had in common was this :
she said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot; and this is a therap@@ ist who sees therap@@ ists , because we have to go to those , because their b@@ .@@ s. meters are good .
what makes you feel vulnerable ? &quot; and within an hour and a half , i had 150 respon@@ ses .
just certain .
this is what i have found : to let ourselves be seen , deeply seen , vulner@@ ably seen ; to love with our whole hear@@ ts , even though there &apos;s no guar@@ an@@ te@@ e -- and that &apos;s really hard , and i can tell you as a parent , that &apos;s ex@@ cruci@@ at@@ ingly difficult -- to practice grati@@ tude and joy in those moments of ter@@ ror , when we &apos;re wondering , &quot; can i love you this much ?
it trac@@ ks your movement through space .
last year , apple fil@@ ed some pat@@ ents to get blood oxy@@ gen@@ ation , heart rate and body temperature via the ear@@ bu@@ ds .
we looked at this and we said , &quot; we &apos;re going to do something with this in an incredibly positive way . &quot;
and he could still hold his wife &apos;s hand , but he couldn &apos;t do but@@ tons on his clo@@ thes , can &apos;t feed himself .
it &apos;s two years of this disease . all of the symp@@ tom@@ s are not there .
and this is my brother &apos;s pro@@ file .
so , can i take this data -- re@@ arr@@ ange yourself , put the symp@@ tom@@ s in the left , the drugs across the top , tell me everything we know about steven and everyone else , and what inter@@ acts .
you don &apos;t want to be on the red line , you want to be on the blue line .
can we find out what &apos;s going to happen to you , so that you can maybe change it ? &quot;
and going forward , you actually don &apos;t want to be a li@@ th@@ ium patient this time .
first time we ever tried it . we &apos;ll try to get it better later
something always seems to stop us .
one of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material , carbon , that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graph@@ ite is bl@@ ast@@ ed by a va@@ po@@ r , and when the va@@ po@@ ri@@ zed carbon con@@ den@@ ses , it con@@ den@@ ses back into a different form : chic@@ ken@@ wire rol@@ led up .
what if we combin@@ ed it with this ?
but in a world where energy is fre@@ ed and trans@@ mit@@ table easily and chea@@ ply , we can take any water wher@@ ever we are and turn it into whatever we need .
but this is different .
this means you can forget about the equ@@ ations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions , so you can actually forget about the equ@@ ations and you just start to look at the interactions .
well , as ow@@ nership is related to control , as i shall explain later , looking at ow@@ nership networks actually can give you answers to questions like , who are the key players ?
and there are different models which allow you to compu@@ te the control you get from ow@@ nership .
the high degree of inter@@ connec@@ tivity of the top players in the core could pose a significant system@@ ic risk to the global economy and we could easily re@@ produce the t@@ n@@ c network with a few simple rules .
and on the other side were all my sister &apos;s my little poni@@ es ready for a c@@ av@@ al@@ ry charge .
the very first thing i want to do is start my talk with a graph .
and very quickly , my brain starts to think that &apos;s the accur@@ ate rati@@ o of negative to positive in the world .
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predic@@ ted not by the ex@@ tern@@ al world , but by the way your brain processes the world .
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve push@@ ed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
it was just life@@ -@@ changing , you know . and so , in my life , you know , i was in the to@@ f@@ u ; it was a family business .
and the problem when you &apos;re youn@@ ger -- for all you students out there -- is , your head gets kind of big really easy .
it took a month to make this part .
we thought , ah , this is when it &apos;s going to happen .
and so i never developed the ability to have a staff .
and i began to wonder , is this the goal ?
very simple boxes : you just press one but@@ ton and some led interaction occu@@ rs .
i brought you guys together again .
so , thank you everyone .
and by the way , all of these numbers are signific@@ antly higher if you happen to be black , if you happen to be poor , if you happen to exist in an over@@ crow@@ ded school .
you can &apos;t have plastic k@@ ni@@ ves and s@@ words and ax@@ es and all that kind of thing in a kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten classroom .
it &apos;s not okay to write these kinds of things in class@@ rooms today .
by the time you &apos;re in first grade , you should be able to read par@@ ag@@ rap@@ h@@ s of text with maybe a picture , maybe not , in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages .
they &apos;re g@@ lor@@ i@@ fied dr@@ ill and practice .
they &apos;re nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tol@@ er@@ ance polici@@ es .
now like with anything that &apos;s really different from the status qu@@ o , it didn &apos;t always go so well testing that air@@ craft .
and that &apos;s the autom@@ ated w@@ ing@@ -@@ fol@@ ding mechan@@ ism .
here &apos;s why .
it &apos;s held every two years in bur@@ ma .
the point is that education doesn &apos;t actually work by teaching you things . it actually works by giving you the impression that you &apos;ve had a very good education , which gives you an in@@ san@@ e sense of un@@ w@@ arr@@ an@@ ted self-@@ confidence , which then makes you very , very successful in later life .
there is your environmental problem solved , by the way , guys : all convic@@ ted child mol@@ es@@ ters have to drive a por@@ s@@ che ca@@ y@@ enne .
but , actually , there is a thing , just as there are ve@@ bl@@ en goods , where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare -- there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous , class@@ less and minim@@ alistic .
in the world of food we call it cooking .
it &apos;s simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions , and the very nature of the decisions changes .
but it &apos;s kind of like fli@@ pping a six or a nine . like a six ,
which i think for anybody involved in technology , is perfectly true .
so i started to consider what i should do , and i thought , i wanted to make my performance better , and to show on@@ stage how spectac@@ ular the y@@ o-@@ yo could be to change the public &apos;s image of the y@@ o-@@ yo .
indeed , some people say it &apos;s the best idea anybody ever had .
this is what makes it so amazing .
so , he took the gre@@ ek word &quot; mim@@ em@@ e , &quot; which means that which is im@@ it@@ ated .
they &apos;re sel@@ fish information , they will get cop@@ i@@ ed , if they can .
why is this useful , or what does it tell us ?
the mem@@ es took a gene machine and turned it into a mem@@ e machine .
and he inclu@@ ded in there the rate of star formation , the rate of planets , but cruci@@ ally , intelligence .
you know all about big brains .
we are the old machines .
&quot; hai@@ ti was not a natural disaster , &quot; says ted fellow peter ha@@ as : &quot; it was a disaster of engineering . &quot; as the country re@@ buil@@ ds after jan@@ u@@ ary &apos;s dea@@ dly qua@@ ke , are bad old building practi@@ ces creating another tic@@ king time bomb ? ha@@ as &apos;s group , ai@@ dg , is helping hai@@ ti &apos;s buil@@ ders learn modern building and engineering practi@@ ces , to assemble a strong country bri@@ ck by bri@@ ck .
we in@@ spec@@ ted government buildings .
and they re@@ did that building .
now , you must have all taken a b@@ and-@@ aid off at some point , and you must have wonder@@ ed what &apos;s the right approach .
but at the end of this process , what i learned was that the nur@@ ses were wrong .
instead , what we saw is a lot of people who che@@ at a little bit .
now , how would you test a personal fu@@ dge factor ?
and then they took the something else , they walked 12 feet to the side , and ex@@ changed it for dollars .
here is what happens .
could it be that with those more dis@@ tant things , it &apos;s not a to@@ ken for one second , it &apos;s something that is many steps re@@ moved from money for a much longer time -- could it be that people will che@@ at even more ?
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nur@@ ses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more system@@ atic experiment@@ ation of our intu@@ i@@ tions .
so i asked nat@@ alie , what do i do ?
then — will i keep going ?
n@@ m : u@@ h , sure .
nat@@ alie . we , u@@ h ...
and these are my parents .
so chi@@ p speci@@ fi@@ cations , ap@@ is , project descri@@ p@@ tions , software tools , hard@@ ware simul@@ ators , c@@ pu em@@ ul@@ ators , stac@@ ks of hundreds of sli@@ des , lec@@ tures -- we l@@ aid out everything on the web and invited the world to come over , take whatever they need , and do whatever they want with it .
and with that in mind , i &apos;d like to say a few words about traditional college grad@@ ing .
but we discovered it by self-@@ exploration .
crisis . death . disaster .
steve pin@@ ker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most pe@@ ac@@ eful time ever in human history .
and i love this : &quot; wat@@ son van@@ qu@@ ish@@ es human op@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
but then the technology of elec@@ tr@@ ol@@ y@@ sis came along and literally made alu@@ minu@@ m so cheap that we use it with thro@@ w@@ -@@ away ment@@ ality .
and if that p@@ ans out , which i have every confidence it will , coca@@ -@@ co@@ la will de@@ plo@@ y this glob@@ ally to 20@@ 6 countries around the planet .
and rather than having economic shu@@ t@@ down , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic inj@@ ection ever .
we have the passion of the di@@ y innov@@ ator .
there &apos;s all sorts of organizations that can use these po@@ ols of very flexi@@ ble people , possibly already once they &apos;ve been in@@ duc@@ ted .
because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get .
but throughout the economy , there are fac@@ ili@@ ties that could li@@ ke@@ wise lever@@ age a new generation of markets for the benefit of all of us .
so imagine that poli@@ cy@@ makers out@@ lin@@ ed a facilit@@ y .
so we &apos;re talking about sec@@ tors like home hair care , the h@@ ire of to@@ ys , farm work , h@@ ire of clo@@ thes even , me@@ als deli@@ vered to your door , services for tour@@ ists , home care .
it really wasn &apos;t until i was invited to the homes of people that i started to understand the human tol@@ l of the epidemic .
ca : that &apos;s an amazing story , thank you .
solar can do it , and we certainly have to develop solar . but we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world .
these two nu@@ cle@@ i , when they &apos;re far apart , are char@@ ged .
and with current re@@ actor technology we really don &apos;t have very much ur@@ an@@ ium .
we &apos;ve got to take that , we &apos;ve got to make that into a fusion re@@ actor . because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the earth .
i &apos;m just saying .
in 19@@ 47 , there was no wind tun@@ nel data beyond m@@ ach 0@@ .@@ 85 .
we must fly again , because amazing , n@@ ever@@ -@@ be@@ en-@@ don@@ e-@@ before things require that you fly .
the result , a four@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ four@@ -@@ in@@ ch can support a stati@@ c load of 6@@ 60 pounds .
now understanding this structure is very important for developing treat@@ ments .
so can you .
chris anderson : reg@@ ina , thank you .
why did we think that this was the time to go biom@@ im@@ ic@@ ry and copy a hum@@ min@@ g@@ bird ?
ca : how do you answer them ?
groups like buil@@ d@@ safe u@@ a@@ e have emerg@@ ed ,
i have a studio in london that has a particular approach to designing buildings .
so we &apos;ve been working with transport for london , and that organization hasn &apos;t actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for 50 years .
it has a child running through a field , or something like that .
so we won the competition to build the u.k. pav@@ ili@@ on .
because the dna of the dinosau@@ r that was tr@@ apped in the am@@ ber gave us some kind of clu@@ e that these tiny things could be tr@@ apped and be made to seem preci@@ ous , rather than looking like nu@@ ts .
a key thing was how people would interact .
they &apos;re just ch@@ op@@ ped at different he@@ i@@ ghts .
you know how new@@ born babies believe they &apos;re part of everything ; they &apos;re not separate ?
but from about the age of five , i was aware that i didn &apos;t fit .
i can har@@ dly find the words to describe the peace i felt when i was acting .
we &apos;d be right in as@@ sum@@ ing that the self is an actual living thing .
but i &apos;m not ash@@ am@@ ed of my self .
and when i &apos;m on my bi@@ ke , i feel that i connect with the profound beauty of israel , and i feel that i &apos;m united with this country &apos;s history and bibli@@ cal law .
so we had a lot of this going on .
so i would say , &quot; al@@ ex , i know that it &apos;s terri@@ bly difficult .
i used to think that reason and logic and rel@@ ent@@ less drive were the only ways to make things happen .
this was the first place where we got some water and sup@@ pli@@ es . &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
now , the carto@@ on is not such an ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation , because studies of identi@@ cal tw@@ ins who were separ@@ ated at birth and then tes@@ ted in adul@@ tho@@ od show that they have aston@@ ishing simil@@ ari@@ ties .
there was indeed reason to be nervous , and there were moments in which i did feel nervous , knowing the history of what has happened to people who &apos;ve taken contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al st@@ ands or discovered dis@@ qui@@ eting fin@@ dings in the behavi@@ oral sciences .
and a more recent one : &quot; the possibility of sustain@@ ing high culture in our time is becoming increasing probl@@ em@@ ati@@ cal .
let me give just you an example to back up that last st@@ atement .
you might think , well , then they &apos;d be even more similar , because not only would they share their genes , but they would also share their environment .
so , normally , i never do any research at all .
al@@ bert re@@ aches in his po@@ cket to pull out , you know , this black ru@@ b@@ ber band but what comes out instead is a k@@ ni@@ fe .
and he says , &quot; like the human@@ e society ? &quot;
i go in , tail comes off .
literally , the transition from ignor@@ ance to knowledge is an@@ ag@@ nor@@ is@@ is . it &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; dir@@ ty jobs &quot; is .
look , i don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
i didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but i was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
we &apos;ve dec@@ lar@@ ed war on work , as a society , all of us .
all of that ? that &apos;s what makes it equ@@ ally as possible as the geni@@ us that goes inside of it .
it &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
now , the reason i begin by saying &quot; no 9 / 11 , no war &quot; is that we have to ac@@ knowledge that islam , as inter@@ pre@@ ted by a very , very small , extremely radical group of people , was a preci@@ pit@@ ating cause of the 9 / 11 att@@ acks -- the preci@@ pit@@ ating cause of the 9 / 11 att@@ acks -- and as a conse@@ quence , at one degree of re@@ move , the preci@@ pit@@ ating cause of the coming war that we &apos;re about to be engag@@ ed in .
well , so says george w@@ . bush .
now , during the cold war , that may have been a defen@@ sible position for the united states to take .
what does it mean to say that there &apos;s an islam@@ ic democracy ?
a personal story , a collective tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h : dy@@ an den@@ a@@ pol@@ i tells the story of the world &apos;s largest volunte@@ er animal res@@ cue , which saved more than 4@@ 0,000 penguins after an oil sp@@ ill off the coast of south africa . how does a job this big get done ? pengu@@ in by pengu@@ in by pengu@@ in ...
we have thousands of o@@ il@@ ed penguins and thousands of willing , but completely in@@ experienced , volunte@@ ers .
so would it be human@@ ly possible to save this many o@@ il@@ ed penguins ?
the first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the a@@ pol@@ lo sea sp@@ ill six years earlier .
and this is cri@@ tically important because , one year ago , the african pengu@@ in was dec@@ lar@@ ed end@@ anger@@ ed .
we call it propag@@ anda gar@@ den@@ ing .
and we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the let@@ ter@@ box before we start , and most importantly of all , we are not dau@@ n@@ ted by the sophisticated argu@@ ments that say , &quot; these small actions are meaning@@ less in the face of tomorrow &apos;s problems , &quot; because i have seen the power of small actions , and it is aw@@ es@@ ome .
we &apos;ve created a company . we are designing and building an a@@ qua@@ pon@@ ics unit in some land that was s@@ pare at the back of the high school , like you do , and now we &apos;re going to be growing fish and veget@@ ables in an or@@ ch@@ ard with bees ,
and although these are really , really small steps , that increasing local economic confidence is starting to play out in a number of ways ,
suddenly , we &apos;re seeing actions on the ground from local government . we &apos;re seeing this ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am@@ ed .
but then i suff@@ ered a series of career catas@@ troph@@ es , one after the other , and finally found myself in television .
you be@@ have in a commit@@ ted way , and then you begin to understand the tru@@ ths of religion .
so the traditions also ins@@ is@@ ted -- and this is an important point , i think -- that you could not and must not conf@@ ine your compassion to your own group : your own nation , your own co-@@ religi@@ on@@ ists , your own fellow coun@@ tr@@ y@@ men . you must have what one of the chinese sages called &quot; j@@ ian ai &quot; : concer@@ n for everybody . love your enem@@ ies . honor the str@@ anger .
it &apos;s a profound moral matter that eng@@ ages and should engage us all .
let &apos;s get back to that . and the idea , too , of je@@ ws , chris@@ ti@@ ans and musli@@ ms -- these traditions now so often at log@@ ger@@ heads -- working together to create a document which we hope will be sig@@ ned by a thousand , at least , of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world .
it &apos;s actually the same person . it &apos;s just one skelet@@ on .
here i was fu@@ m@@ bling around in the ladies &apos; under@@ wear department of a department store , almost got es@@ cor@@ ted from the pre@@ mises .
so , i have to use a 198@@ 0s dr@@ um scanner , which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film .
the color@@ ing , so color@@ ing ad@@ ds another level to the x-@@ r@@ ays .
he &apos;s got head@@ phones on , reading the newspaper , got a h@@ at on , gl@@ asses , got a ba@@ g .
yeah , i &apos;m quite ple@@ ased with it .
i &apos;m also working now with x-@@ ray video .
what are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? &quot;
he lear@@ ns his wh@@ ys and where@@ for@@ es , his causes and cor@@ relations , his logic , his fall@@ ac@@ ies .
we know this because they did an experiment . &quot;
now re@@ incar@@ nation , that &apos;s another thing gone -- the after@@ life .
it is basically mom@@ ent@@ um to energy where the four@@ -@@ v@@ ector is constant -- that &apos;s what it is .
i stopped obser@@ ving the house for a moment , and when i started obser@@ ving again , everything had happened . &quot;
thank you very much . goo@@ d@@ by@@ e .
you become a chris@@ tian , musli@@ m , je@@ w .
i &apos;ve met women and men all over this planet , who through various circum@@ st@@ ances -- war , poverty , rac@@ ism , multiple forms of violence -- have never known security , or have had their illusion of security forever dev@@ ast@@ ated .
the government finally made a decision that &quot; the vag@@ ina mono@@ logues &quot; could not be per@@ formed in ug@@ anda .
when she began her mission eight years ago , she was re@@ v@@ il@@ ed , she was det@@ es@@ ted , she was completely sl@@ ander@@ ed in her community .
ee : i think that if you think about women , women are the primary resource of the planet . they give birth , we come from them , they are mothers , they are visi@@ on@@ aries , they are the future . if you think that the u.n. now says that one out of three women on the planet will be rap@@ ed or be@@ aten in their lifetime , we &apos;re talking about the des@@ ec@@ ration of the primary resource of the planet , we &apos;re talking about the place where we come from , we &apos;re talking about par@@ ent@@ ing .
on the other hand , we kids still dream about perf@@ ection .
my own parents had anything but low expect@@ ations for me and my sister .
kids need opportunities to lead and succe@@ ed .
and so students like myself with nothing to do , we would learn how to program it .
here &apos;s cli@@ ve sin@@ clair now laun@@ ching his color computer .
of course the newsp@@ ap@@ ers love to beat on this . but 8@@ 3 percent of games don &apos;t have any m@@ ature content what@@ so@@ ever , so it &apos;s just not true .
they &apos;re actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other .
video : i , like many of you , live somewhere between reality and video games .
i know i can .
perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gu@@ t instinc@@ ts , the things we know to do before we even think .
i know though , that no matter how amazing video games may become , or how flat the real world may seem to us ,
she &apos;s never going to know a world where the graph@@ ics just aren &apos;t stun@@ ning and really immer@@ sive .
and to prove it , she says , &quot; the exact size and shape of these tab@@ let@@ ops is the same , and i &apos;m going to prove it to you . &quot;
but mur@@ ray g@@ ell@@ -@@ mann yesterday talked about emerg@@ ent properties ;
now let &apos;s go to young children .
and the mathematici@@ ans and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progr@@ essions as a fir@@ st-@@ order dis@@ cre@@ te differ@@ enti@@ al equ@@ ation and a secon@@ d-@@ order dis@@ cre@@ te differ@@ enti@@ al equ@@ ation ,
and we can refl@@ ect here the way g@@ illi@@ an is@@ hi@@ j@@ im@@ a did .
we can take a movie of what &apos;s going on , but even if we single ste@@ pped this movie , it &apos;s tric@@ ky to see what &apos;s going on .
but we couldn &apos;t create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life .
the reason for that is really very simple .
and there is no o@@ dy@@ s@@ sey to our own moon , much less the mo@@ ons of ju@@ p@@ iter .
as an out@@ growth of that , as a child of that revolution , is the revolution in biology .
we look the same to a vis@@ it@@ or from another planet , maybe , but not to each other because we com@@ pe@@ te with each other all time .
it &apos;s a total media cir@@ cus .
the second is , we &apos;re human .
and to lose touch with the basic rhy@@ th@@ ms of our biology and our health .
so to me , it &apos;s clear that one of the foun@@ dations of that future is going to be the re@@ working of our biology .
and when she was eight , last year , she was doing a report for school or she had some hom@@ ework about fro@@ gs .
that &apos;s exactly how it happens . &quot; so we &apos;re driving home and she &apos;s looking out the window , and she goes , &quot; mom . what if two just people saw each other on the street , like a man and a woman , they just started doing it . would that ever happen ? &quot; and i said , &quot; oh , no . humans are so private .
you know what they say ?
yeah .
they are shap@@ ing our very des@@ ires .
and since you &apos;re in my kitchen , please meet my wife .
they can dis@@ appear and es@@ cape bul@@ lets .
but they came up with a book , looking back at 13 years of political crisis in iv@@ ory coast .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
well , don bro@@ wn@@ lee , my friend , and i finally got to the point where we got ti@@ red of turning on the tv and seeing the spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps and seeing the ali@@ ens every night , and tried to write a counter@@ -@@ argument to it , and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habit@@ able , for a planet to be an earth , to have a place where you could probably get not just life , but complexity , which requires a huge amount of evolution , and therefore const@@ ancy of conditions .
we are right now in the beautiful ore@@ o of existence -- of at least life on planet earth -- following the first horrible micro@@ bi@@ al age .
and that &apos;s what happens in an astero@@ id catastrophe , because that &apos;s what this was , of course . this is the famous k-@@ t .
this is a g@@ org@@ on@@ op@@ si@@ an , or a g@@ org@@ on .
there &apos;s no dinosaurs yet ; just this slow , sau@@ ri@@ an , scal@@ y , na@@ sty , sw@@ am@@ p@@ y place with a couple of tiny mam@@ m@@ als hi@@ ding in the fr@@ ing@@ es .
in this particular case , the source over and over has been flo@@ od bas@@ al@@ ts .
but the thing about this is that every once in a while we di@@ vers can run into trouble , so i &apos;m going to do a little thought experiment here .
here is a way we can get people to critical care .
so , what we &apos;re looking at now : does it leave a signal ?
every year when it comes to the cot@@ ton harv@@ est , the government shu@@ ts down the schools , puts the kids in bu@@ ses , bu@@ ses them to the cot@@ ton fields to spend three weeks harv@@ es@@ ting the cot@@ ton .
the problem is that the active ingre@@ di@@ ent in there -- as i mentioned earlier -- comes from pig@@ s .
and the simple answer is they can &apos;t . they &apos;re national .
but you lose that contr@@ act for a major brand name , that &apos;s the difference between st@@ aying in business or going ban@@ k@@ ru@@ pt .
so what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re not only en@@ list@@ ing the mul@@ tin@@ ation@@ als , we &apos;re giving them the tools to deliver this public good -- respect for human rights -- and we &apos;re chec@@ king .
we have 4@@ ,000 companies who are members .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and no matter how many land mines er@@ u@@ pt in a minute , be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life .
why was the scar@@ ec@@ row invited to ted ?
and it was here , listening to these po@@ ets share their stories , that i learned that spo@@ ken word poetry didn &apos;t have to be indi@@ gn@@ ant , it could be fun or pa@@ in@@ ful or serious or sil@@ ly .
and here &apos;s what happens , and here &apos;s what you would discover too if we all started sharing our li@@ sts out lou@@ d .
and yes , that means cat@@ ching all of those mis@@ eries and hur@@ t , but it also means that when beautiful , amazing things just fall out of the sky , i &apos;m ready to catch them .
and i always thought that my beginning was at the bo@@ wer@@ y poetry club , but it &apos;s possible that it was much earlier .
it &apos;s what i stri@@ ve for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection .
as someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible , standing in front of an audience is a cross between an ou@@ t-@@ of@@ -@@ body experience and a de@@ er caught in the head@@ lights , so please for@@ give me for viol@@ ating one of the ted comman@@ d@@ ments by rel@@ ying on words on paper , and i only hope i &apos;m not stru@@ ck by ligh@@ t@@ ning bol@@ ts before i &apos;m done .
that was a tradition i wanted to follow .
the bos@@ ni@@ an soldi@@ er who gu@@ ided me told me that all of his friends were there now .
in 199@@ 4 , after three months of co@@ vering the south african el@@ ection , i saw the in@@ au@@ gu@@ ration of n@@ el@@ son mandel@@ a , and it was the most up@@ lif@@ ting thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
going dee@@ per into the leg@@ acy of the eastern european reg@@ im@@ es , i worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution , where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population .
a mal@@ nour@@ ished child being measu@@ red as part of the suppl@@ ement@@ al feeding program .
a mark@@ et@@ place was hit by a mor@@ tar sh@@ ell that killed several members of a single family .
so there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an el@@ ection does .
and you cannot help but feel ex@@ hau@@ sted at the idea of trying to make elec@@ tions better .
if the government wants to find out how you vot@@ ed , they won &apos;t be able to .
i went out to al@@ ca@@ tra@@ z , and i lived on the island for several weeks .
more than two -- you &apos;re reading about larry page already , somebody re@@ ads very fast .
in that year , there were 3@@ 4 countries affected with small@@ po@@ x .
and in 19@@ 80 we dec@@ lar@@ ed the globe free of small@@ po@@ x .
in your ted pack@@ ages there &apos;s a d@@ v@@ d , &quot; infin@@ ite vision , &quot; about dr. v and the ar@@ av@@ ind eye hospital .
then there &apos;ll be second@@ ary out@@ brea@@ ks , and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won &apos;t know what hit you .
but in all seri@@ ousness -- because this idea is birth@@ ed in ted ,
they re@@ ported this to who . who took a little while taking action because who will only rece@@ ive a report from a government , because it &apos;s the united nations .
i call them &quot; the my@@ stic &quot; and &quot; the w@@ arri@@ or . &quot;
and it can be sort of craz@@ y-@@ making , hou@@ sing both the my@@ stic and the w@@ arri@@ or in one body .
maybe that person who wor@@ ships at the mos@@ que , or the church or the syn@@ ag@@ o@@ gue , down the street . or someone from the other side of the abor@@ tion conflict . or maybe your bro@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law who doesn &apos;t believe in global warming . anyone whose lifes@@ ty@@ le may fri@@ gh@@ ten you , or whose point of view makes smo@@ ke come out of your ears .
ne@@ i@@ ther of us had tried to change the other .
al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of boston .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the tr@@ ash@@ can behind the house .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bure@@ au@@ cr@@ acy sex@@ y .
but these app@@ s are like little digital re@@ min@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers , and we &apos;re not just consum@@ ers of government , putting in our tax@@ es and getting back services .
parado@@ x@@ ically , when i let go of these objec@@ tives , and worked from a place of compassion and purpose , looking for excell@@ ence , rather than the results of it , everything arrived on its own , including ful@@ f@@ ill@@ ment .
he ris@@ ked his life as he walked up to people whose families he &apos;d mur@@ der@@ ed .
sometimes , when the war is over and all the film cre@@ ws have left , the most inspir@@ ing stories are the ones that flo@@ at just bene@@ ath the r@@ ad@@ ar .
something wonderful in a country where manu@@ al labor is often looked down upon .
we get information in the mail , the regular pos@@ tal mail , en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted or not , v@@ et it like a regular news organization , form@@ at it -- which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant dat@@ ab@@ ases of information -- release it to the public and then def@@ end ourselves against the inev@@ itable legal and political att@@ acks .
and that , after a couple of days , made the ken@@ y@@ an press feel safe to talk about it .
ja : the impact on the people who worked on it was sev@@ ere .
ca : so let &apos;s talk a little more broad@@ ly about this .
that &apos;s what they see every day .
and we got a report -- a sort of engineering analysis into what happened -- saying that , in fact , security gu@@ ards from some riv@@ al , various comp@@ eting oil fir@@ ms had , in fact , par@@ ked tru@@ cks there and blo@@ wn them up .
and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quanti@@ ty of wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer dis@@ clo@@ sures of a very high cali@@ ber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and v@@ et this information .
ja : i &apos;m not sure about the inci@@ dent .
and just a month ago , this was passed by the ic@@ el@@ an@@ di@@ c par@@ li@@ ament un@@ anim@@ ously . ca : wow .
now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea .
and the so@@ y sauce results were in@@ conclu@@ sive because of the large data range , but it seems like so@@ y sauce actually increas@@ ed the potential car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens .
got rej@@ ected by all except one .
in fact , it means that if a patient comes in and they &apos;re res@@ istant to this drug , then if we give them a chemical to block this protein , then we can treat them again with the same drug .
they &apos;re everywhere .
and if you &apos;re re@@ mod@@ eling your house , take out all the car@@ p@@ eting and put in hard@@ wood flo@@ or@@ ing . &quot; because these solutions are natural , these solutions are sustainable , and these solutions are long-term invest@@ ments -- long-term invest@@ ments that we &apos;re making for our generation and for future generations .
i find weather extremely fascinating .
but it &apos;s also used to as@@ sign a temperature range .
&lt; transcript &gt;
around the same time , i was going through an audi@@ tion -- the first ever open audi@@ tion by national television in china -- with another thousand college girls .
she showed off her expensive bag@@ s , clo@@ thes and car on her micro@@ blog , which is the chinese version of twitter .
the illi@@ ter@@ acy rate in china among this generation is under one percent .
but then in the last two years , it goes up again to 3@@ 9 percent , indi@@ c@@ ating a ris@@ ing living cost .
they &apos;re not rich at all .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and people would come up to me after the conference , after my talk , men and women .
and then another pair of legs we collabor@@ ated on were these -- look like j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish legs ,
larry l@@ essi@@ g , the net ’ s most celebr@@ ated law@@ yer , c@@ ites john phili@@ p sou@@ sa , cel@@ esti@@ al copy@@ rights and the &quot; as@@ cap car@@ tel &quot; in his argument for re@@ vi@@ ving our creative culture .
now , that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regul@@ ation of land , until this technology came along , and people began to wonder , were these instruments tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ers
it &apos;s how they understand access to this culture .
because , of course , every technique that you &apos;ve seen here is something that television and film produc@@ ers the importance is that that technique has been demo@@ crati@@ zed .
so , for example , they can say their work is available fre@@ ely for non-@@ commercial , this am@@ at@@ eur@@ -@@ type of use ,
i &apos;m supposed to s@@ care you , because it &apos;s about fear , right ?
and we &apos;re beginning to find these little things for malaria , for si@@ ck@@ le cell , for cancers .
we should have known that this exis@@ ted because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the na@@ ked eye .
now , the last of these things died in september 19@@ 3@@ 6 .
because this thing co@@ des ones and zer@@ os , and this thing co@@ des a , t , c , gs , and it s@@ its up there , absor@@ bing energy on a tree , and one fine day it has enough energy to say , ex@@ ecu@@ te , and it goes &#91; th@@ um@@ p &#93; . right ?
that &apos;s perfectly clear . so , men read that sentence , and they look at that sentence , and they read this .
it won &apos;t do anything for you .
and you can break it out by coun@@ ties , because it &apos;s specific coun@@ ties .
here &apos;s how many people it takes to produce a single u.s. pat@@ ent .
and the really interesting thing is , you and your kids are em@@ powered to build great emp@@ ires , and you don &apos;t need a lot to do it .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and it &apos;s important to make a distin@@ ction , because if the news is anything to go by , 40 percent of americans can &apos;t -- either can &apos;t afford health insur@@ ance or have the most in@@ a@@ de@@ qu@@ ate health insur@@ ance , and have a president who , despite the prot@@ est of millions of his citizens -- even his own congr@@ ess -- contin@@ ues to pro@@ sec@@ ute a sen@@ sel@@ ess war .
basically , it ends up as &quot; god is on a bicy@@ cle with his ang@@ els . &quot;
the next day , tom op@@ ens his lun@@ ch@@ box , there &apos;s rice , so he thro@@ ws himself off and kill@@ s himself , and tom , di@@ ck and h@@ arry follow .
and when the book came out , i was her@@ al@@ ded as africa &apos;s answer to fre@@ der@@ ick for@@ sy@@ th , which is a du@@ bi@@ ous honor at best .
and it &apos;s not the look of hor@@ ror and ter@@ ror on fr@@ aser &apos;s face that stop@@ s id@@ r@@ is or us ; it &apos;s the look in fr@@ aser &apos;s eyes .
sometimes i can stand before the world and say , &quot; my name is chris aban@@ i .
weeks ago , you broke me as a woman once sh@@ at@@ tered me into a song bene@@ ath her weight , before you s@@ lou@@ ched into that gr@@ ass@@ y hus@@ h .
i can &apos;t even get a coffee date at star@@ bu@@ cks .
that &apos;s seven percent of reven@@ ues .
we lie more to str@@ ang@@ ers than we lie to co@@ workers .
it &apos;s starts really , really early .
studies show that people who are over@@ deter@@ min@@ ed in their den@@ ial will res@@ ort to forma@@ l rather than informa@@ l language .
they cannot be consci@@ ously contr@@ acted , especially if you over@@ did the bot@@ o@@ x .
now that smile is known in the trade as &quot; du@@ ping deli@@ ght . &quot;
and in the presence of con@@ temp@@ t , whether or not dec@@ e@@ ption fol@@ lows -- and it doesn &apos;t always follow -- look the other way , go the other direction , re@@ consider the deal , say , &quot; no thank you . i &apos;m not coming up for just one more ni@@ ght@@ cap . thank you . &quot;
what you want to look for here is an incredible dis@@ cre@@ p@@ ancy between horri@@ fic events that she descri@@ bes and her very , very cool dem@@ e@@ an@@ or .
our man@@ ic t@@ we@@ eting and tex@@ ting can blind us to the fact that the sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties of human dec@@ ency -- character integr@@ ity -- that &apos;s still what matters , that &apos;s always what &apos;s going to matter .
this is the name of my company , giving to@@ ys .
it does pretty good .
and you can see the massi@@ vely par@@ alle@@ l processing n@@ int@@ end@@ os there .
i did the body and creature -- well , you &apos;ll see .
i try to do a lot of philosophy , a lot of thinking about all of these projects .
so she comes to the res@@ cue .
so now i have to really figure out all kinds of stuff i don &apos;t know how to do .
and there &apos;s my youn@@ g@@ est daughter with her fur@@ b@@ ys .
here &apos;s an example of what we did with the sk@@ u@@ ll .
and you can see we got a guy from -- who &apos;s just a f@@ an@@ atic about dinosaurs to do the sculp@@ ting for us , down to the spo@@ on-@@ shaped teeth and everything .
that &apos;s what the invest@@ ors think , that it &apos;s just -- -- right , right . so they &apos;re really sweet little guys .
that &apos;s why ple@@ o &apos;s soft and gent@@ le and lo@@ ving .
so why does this matter ?
they said , &quot; you roll the ball , you hear some p@@ ins go down .
in just five years , their rati@@ o went from one wor@@ ker for every 3@@ 0,000 people to one wor@@ ker for every 2,@@ 500 people .
let &apos;s listen to this song that co@@ ke created for it , &quot; w@@ av@@ in &apos; fla@@ g &quot; by a som@@ al@@ i hi@@ p ho@@ p artist .
well , you work with the community .
in 2009 , we &apos;re down to 1,@@ 600 cases .
we have a problem with marketing in the don@@ or community .
if jo@@ e ju@@ mped in a coral re@@ ef , there are many things the ali@@ en could see .
and many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your bas@@ el@@ ine .
and they fil@@ ter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and patho@@ gens .
but , little did i know , until i ju@@ mped for the first time in a marine res@@ erve .
one point three million eg@@ gs per square meter inside the marine res@@ erve where these sn@@ ails are very ab@@ un@@ dant .
so we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take ro@@ cket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fis@@ her@@ y is going to collapse very quickly .
the tri@@ vi@@ al solution is to create really large protected areas like the ch@@ agos archi@@ pel@@ ago .
and we need to develop a new model of part@@ nership , truly collabor@@ ative , where we are looking for compl@@ ement@@ ing , not sub@@ stitu@@ ting .
we think this is universal .
with vibr@@ ant video cli@@ ps cap@@ tured by sub@@ mar@@ ines , david gall@@ o takes us to some of earth &apos;s dar@@ k@@ est , most violent , tox@@ ic and beautiful habit@@ ats , the val@@ le@@ ys and volcan@@ ic ri@@ d@@ ges of the oceans &apos; dep@@ ths , where life is bizarre , res@@ ili@@ ent and sho@@ c@@ king@@ ly ab@@ un@@ dant .
here &apos;s a j@@ el@@ ly .
they go from a couple of in@@ ches to a couple of feet .
this is an ic@@ on of our robot , j@@ as@@ on , it &apos;s called .
a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here .
on one of the last di@@ ve series , we coun@@ ted 200 species in these areas --
they don &apos;t need the sun at all .
there are a number of groups that are propos@@ ing that life evolved at these vent sites .
what we &apos;re learning now , it &apos;s almost like a sym@@ phon@@ y .
for example , fac@@ tor@@ ing qu@@ ad@@ rati@@ cs with leading co@@ effici@@ ents greater than one .
i &apos;m here to tell you that the way our t@@ ext@@ books -- particularly mass@@ -@@ adop@@ ted t@@ ext@@ books -- teach math reas@@ oning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functi@@ on@@ ally equivalent to turning on &quot; two and a half men &quot; and calling it a day .
so i want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
none of it &apos;s a dis@@ tr@@ actor , so we lose that .
because the the@@ ore@@ tical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s e@@ dition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scar@@ y to talk about sources of error when the the@@ ore@@ tical does not match up with the practical .
we need more patient problem sol@@ vers . thank you .
and they have absolutely amazing education systems .
199@@ 4 , ro@@ dri@@ go started something called c@@ di , which took computers don@@ ated by corpor@@ ations , put them into community centers in fav@@ el@@ as and created places like this .
this is a place called the ma@@ dan@@ gir@@ i set@@ t@@ lement colon@@ y , which is a very developed slu@@ m about 25 minutes outside new delhi , where i met these characters who showed me around for the day .
but they find it completely obvious to use computers , web@@ sites , make videos , so on and so forth .
imagine an education system that started from questions , not from knowledge to be im@@ par@@ ted , or started from a game , not from a lesson , or started from the pre@@ mise that you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them .
here , there isn &apos;t really an option .
you know a chinese restaurant when you see it .
there are big picture schools in the u.s. and austr@@ alia .
it will lay waste to ap@@ petite . it will lay waste to social confidence .
age not at all as patho@@ logy ; age as potential .
and there isn &apos;t much we can do about that .
perhaps we still suff@@ er from a psy@@ ch@@ ic pain , a w@@ ound .
and he wrote this : &quot; everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing , your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation .
jon@@ athan dr@@ or@@ i : the beautiful tric@@ ks of f@@ lowers
so all the gr@@ asses , which means all of the cer@@ eal cro@@ ps , and most of the trees have w@@ ind@@ -@@ bor@@ ne pollen .
this is a plant here that insects in south africa just love ,
so it &apos;s dec@@ e@@ iv@@ ing on two levels --
fabul@@ ous thing .
these are little yellow f@@ lowers like we all see , little yellow f@@ lowers all over the place .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
see again , the diversity .
and then you &apos;re going to see people start to ga@@ ther in the center of the city to celebr@@ ate the night before , which happens right here .
i took the first 10,000 she@@ ep that i coll@@ ected , and i put them on a website called thes@@ he@@ ep@@ mark@@ et@@ .com where you can actually buy collec@@ tions of 20 she@@ ep .
it &apos;s about your own inter@@ pret@@ ation and doing something different . &quot;
you may recognize these two guys .
we made a music video for one of my favorite ban@@ ds , radio@@ head .
collabor@@ ator three : for all of the fram@@ es to be dra@@ wn by f@@ ans , each individual frame , it &apos;s got a very powerful feeling to it .
and this is called &quot; the wil@@ der@@ ness down@@ town . &quot;
why we might be vic@@ ti@@ ms of these career cris@@ es , as we &apos;re wee@@ ping sof@@ tly into our pil@@ lows .
i think we live in a society which has simply pe@@ gg@@ ed certain emotional re@@ wards to the acqu@@ is@@ ition of material goods .
she comes from an od@@ d place .
it &apos;s a beautiful idea . the problem is if you really believe in a society where those who mer@@ it to get to the top , get to the top , you &apos;ll also , by impli@@ cation , and in a far more na@@ sty way , believe in a society where those who des@@ erve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there .
there are simply too many random fac@@ tors :
in other words , they have failed . and they are described as &quot; lo@@ s@@ ers . &quot;
he is not a lo@@ ser , though he has lost .
my own theory of success -- and i &apos;m somebody who is very interested in success . i really want to be successful .
and make sure that we own them , that we are truly the auth@@ ors of our own ambi@@ tions .
which is the auth@@ or@@ itarian , discipl@@ in@@ arian , on the one hand ,
no one &apos;s ever done it without a shark cage .
and there &apos;s de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation .
and there &apos;s nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this .
and the next thing is paraly@@ sis .
and they got me out and they started again with the ep@@ ine@@ ph@@ r@@ ine and the pre@@ d@@ n@@ is@@ one and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board .
i was swimming with this thing on .
but i &apos;m ready .
so among them , i have been a she@@ ph@@ er@@ d@@ ess , a tru@@ ck driver , a factory wor@@ ker , a clean@@ ing lady .
so i did a series of work where it was identi@@ cal words in french and in english .
so sometimes i view from the inside , like e@@ go@@ centr@@ ic@@ ity and the inner cir@@ cles .
here is a three-@@ week pap@@ er@@ cutting mar@@ ath@@ on at the museum of arts and design in new york city .
it &apos;s called &quot; fashion st@@ atement , &quot; and there are quot@@ es about fashion , so you can read it , and also , because the definition of artist book is very gener@@ ous .
and then the fru@@ it of the world for silicon valley today .
so i brought back the rab@@ bit , the drag@@ on@@ fly , to stay in that street .
but that &apos;s not the hard part . &quot; so here &apos;s a list of problems that come up .
and there &apos;s one solution that &apos;s probably only a few years off .
and so maybe if we lived 200 years , we could accumul@@ ate enough skills and knowledge to solve some problems .
so i see emotions as highly evolved sub@@ sets of your cap@@ ability .
and it &apos;s with us today .
is because we can trans@@ c@@ end listening to the val@@ ve sounds , and the breath sounds , because now ,
flu@@ id status , that &apos;s really important if you &apos;re monit@@ or@@ ing somebody with heart failure .
a lot of you have gotten that ph@@ illi@@ ps direct life .
so , now i want to move to sleep .
this was really fascinating because this gave that quanti@@ tation about all the different ph@@ ases of sleep .
al@@ z@@ heimer &apos;s disease : there &apos;s five million people affected , and you can check v@@ ital sig@@ ns , activity , balance . as@@ th@@ ma : large number , we could det@@ ect things like pollen count , air quality , respir@@ atory rate . breast cancer ,
it &apos;s the number one source of commerce , and interes@@ t@@ ingly it do@@ vet@@ ails beauti@@ fully with over 500 life science companies .
we lose 7@@ 00,000 people a year in the u.s. from sudden cardia@@ c death .
there &apos;s a chef in sp@@ ain named fer@@ ran ad@@ ri@@ a .
but we had a philosophy , which is it only has to look good for a thou@@ sand@@ th of a second .
so we have two hal@@ ves of one of the best kit@@ ch@@ ens in the world .
but now you will ; we put a bio@@ graph@@ y of james wat@@ t in .
there &apos;s a mus@@ h@@ room , k@@ et@@ ch@@ up -- it goes on and on .
and while i &apos;ve tried to make my images not too graphi@@ c , keep in mind that surge@@ ons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do ,
these guys con@@ fin@@ ed their surgery to fairly super@@ fici@@ al inju@@ ries .
surgery didn &apos;t hur@@ t anymore , but it killed you pretty quickly .
some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years ,
now , what you put between those instruments and those hands , is a large , fairly complicated robot .
and the problem is it gets ti@@ me-@@ consum@@ ing , and cu@@ m@@ ber@@ some .
we need to be able to guide what we &apos;re cutting in a much better way .
and we can leave the patient whole and int@@ act and functi@@ onal after@@ wards .
well , if you teach , if you wor@@ ship in the temp@@ le of learning , do not mo@@ ck the go@@ ds ,
this is not about jobs that su@@ ck .
they come into sl@@ aver@@ y because someone has asked them this question .
so , that &apos;s a scen@@ ario that we think we should be capit@@ aliz@@ ing on .
you buy them chea@@ ply , you use them ,
and it can be done .
and america is still paying the price for the bot@@ ched em@@ anci@@ pation of 18@@ 65 .

in some it is hot .
and charles just chec@@ king it out there .
so i &apos;ve always liked this prototype picture .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style is gri@@ ds . let &apos;s make the chair gri@@ d@@ dy . &quot;
design was not something other .
audience : party . love . ed : okay , good .
other things could have happened . the japanese could have discovered monter@@ ey .
now we &apos;re going to do some movies . &quot; it was always part of how they looked at the world . and that &apos;s what &apos;s really powerful .
and it &apos;s kind of cool for me to be part of a family and a tradition where he was talking about that in 197@@ 8 .
and these were steel , mic@@ a , plastic , cop@@ per and nic@@ k@@ el .
and so this is after a day and about half a night sm@@ el@@ ting this ir@@ on .
and for a while that was looking really good .

an old lady , cr@@ ying , was car@@ ried out of her house and up the road by her son .
voice 2 : it &apos;s coming again ?
there are a few blog@@ gers -- somewhere maybe around 20 , now -- who do , in fact , make some kind of money , and a few who are actually trying to make a ful@@ l-@@ time living out of it , but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it or they love the attention , or whatever it is .
one of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the internet , and you spend a lot of time thinking about the internet , is that it is very easy to fall in love with the internet .
but we know that occa@@ sion@@ ally ants go as@@ tr@@ ay , and what happens is that , if army ants are wan@@ der@@ ing around and they get lost , they start to follow a simple rule -- just do what the ant in front of you does .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
and i was asked , &quot; well aren &apos;t you nervous ?
because if you double one percent seven more times , which is exactly what happened , you get 100 percent . and the project was finished on time .
what used to take up a building now fits in our po@@ ck@@ ets .
d@@ ean k@@ am@@ en pre@@ vie@@ ws a new pros@@ thetic arm
i went down to washington . i saw these guys , and said , &quot; i did what you asked me . i looked at what &apos;s out there .
now he &apos;s going to pick up a p@@ en with his op@@ posed th@@ um@@ b and inde@@ x finger .
it all began when two scientists , f@@ red gr@@ ass@@ le and j@@ esse au@@ su@@ bel , met in wo@@ ods hole , mass@@ ach@@ us@@ et@@ ts where both were gu@@ ests at the fam@@ ed oce@@ an@@ ographic institute .
and with sal@@ ting , it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances .
and the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water , unlike light .
well what they found was mis@@ lab@@ eled fish .
and what we find if we plo@@ t up the well-@@ known species is this sort of a distribution .
one of the things that we &apos;re taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that &apos;s going to come out in the journal plo@@ s biology .
and that &apos;s the deep sea , that &apos;s the environment that we consider to be among the most pr@@ ist@@ ine left on earth .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so we &apos;ve been doing this for a couple of years , and that &apos;s our lab .
one was to ted@@ med , and one , as you &apos;ve heard , was a regular ted two years ago .
you &apos;ve heard that word several times in the last four days , and everyone &apos;s familiar with ku@@ h@@ ni@@ an paradig@@ ms .
he must see himself and the world through the eyes of another , and of many others .
and i &apos;ll read you what it is .
now for those who don &apos;t believe this argument , we have trees and gr@@ ass on our planet without the brain , but the clin@@ ching evidence is this animal here -- the hum@@ ble sea squ@@ ir@@ t .
when it comes to being d@@ ex@@ ter@@ ous , it &apos;s not even clear what the algorith@@ m is you have to solve to be d@@ ex@@ ter@@ ous .
now by noise , i do not mean sound .
so we &apos;re going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one -- zero meaning i don &apos;t believe it at all , one means i &apos;m absolutely certain .
as we go around , we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down , but we also learn about how no@@ is@@ y our own sensor@@ y appar@@ at@@ us is , and then combine those in a real b@@ ay@@ es@@ ian way .
everything left over is ex@@ tern@@ al to me .
because the tick@@ le sensation on the pal@@ m comes and goes , you need large numbers of subj@@ ects with these stars making them significant .
but cri@@ tically , they &apos;re bri@@ e@@ f@@ ed about the rules of the game in separate rooms .
you will know what this person is doing , whether happy , sad , old , young -- a huge amount of information .
so you want to avoid big forces as one principle .
i &apos;m really scar@@ ed . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it .
i mean , why would you try to re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ate a whole store ?
about that green tech network i described .
well , two dollars , two dollars is too much for africa .
and who would have thought that all that is not enough ?
because if we do , i can look forward to the conversation i &apos;m going to have with my daughter in 20 years .
and then you start this crazy sor@@ ting process that never -- it &apos;s just nu@@ ts .
just beautiful --
ta@@ -@@ da .
and yes , the red planet is red .
there are po@@ lar cap@@ s of north pole and south pole .
so , there is a lot of water below the surface .
that &apos;s because the northern h@@ emis@@ ph@@ ere is the region of the ancient ocean bas@@ in .
and we can search for life on mars .
main engine start , and lif@@ to@@ ff .
it took about three hours to get up there --
and this sp@@ re@@ ads on out end@@ less@@ ly into a distance .
and this holds for ger@@ ms , ideas , product adop@@ tion , behavi@@ ors , and the like .
now , who would you rather be if a ju@@ ic@@ y piece of go@@ ssi@@ p were sp@@ reading through the network ?
the friends of rand@@ om@@ ly cho@@ sen people have higher degree , and are more central than the random people themselves .
it could de@@ pend on the nature of the patho@@ gen -- different patho@@ gens , using this technique , you &apos;d get different war@@ ning -- or other phenomen@@ a that are sp@@ reading , or fran@@ kly , on the structure of the human network .
so , if we have a population of a thousand people , and we want to make the population imm@@ une to a patho@@ gen , we don &apos;t have to imm@@ uni@@ ze every single person .
so , for example , we could use tru@@ ck@@ ers &apos; pur@@ ch@@ ases of fuel .
ben k@@ ac@@ y@@ ra : ancient won@@ ders cap@@ tured in 3d
let me show you some of them : chi@@ chen it@@ z@@ a , rap@@ a nu@@ i -- and what you &apos;re seeing here are the cloud of points -- bab@@ yl@@ on , ro@@ ss@@ ly@@ n chap@@ el , pom@@ pe@@ ii , and our lat@@ est project , m@@ t . rus@@ h@@ more , our most challeng@@ ing projects .
this inclu@@ des , for example , the 3d laser scann@@ ing systems , ever more powerful personal computers , 3d graph@@ ics , high-@@ definition digital photograph@@ y , not to mention the internet .
we were very lucky to have two of our partners particip@@ ate in this : the histor@@ ic scot@@ land , and the gl@@ as@@ go@@ w school of art .
why no hear@@ ings , no den@@ un@@ ci@@ ations , no people getting ar@@ res@@ ted in front of the rw@@ and@@ an emb@@ ass@@ y or in front of the white house ? what &apos;s the deal ?
it &apos;s got all the u@@ ps and the do@@ w@@ ns of movements .
why the lim@@ its to the movement ?
now , who was ser@@ gi@@ o ? ser@@ gi@@ o vie@@ ira de m@@ ell@@ o was his name .
talk about evil prev@@ ail@@ ing . i mean , here he was in the room with the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of evil in cam@@ bo@@ dia .
so ser@@ gi@@ o -- this re@@ cep@@ tac@@ le of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with bro@@ ken@@ ness , lay under the ru@@ bble for three and a half hours without res@@ cue .
he started , as i mentioned , to get in the room with evil , to not den@@ oun@@ ce , and became almost ob@@ se@@ qui@@ ous when he won the nic@@ k@@ name ser@@ bi@@ o , for instance , and even when he negoti@@ ated with the kh@@ mer rouge would black@@ -@@ box what had occurred pri@@ or to ent@@ ering the room .
in times of fear , for instance , one of the things ser@@ gi@@ o used to say is , fear is a bad ad@@ vis@@ or .
first , i &apos;ll ask you : why should you care ?
and the baby &apos;s cr@@ y really pen@@ e@@ tr@@ ated me , as a mother .
and in this slide you see the neurons and the syn@@ ap@@ ses of the brain don &apos;t form .
so i am convinced that if we can un@@ lock the technologies that are com@@ mon@@ place in the ri@@ cher world to be able to transform fo@@ ods .
i &apos;d like to talk about what i call our war@@ e@@ houses for hope .
it is a win@@ -@@ win@@ -@@ win situation that starts the food economy moving .
well , the world bank estimat@@ es it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 10@@ .@@ 3 -- to address mal@@ nutrition in those countries .
but when you start to read the article by c@@ lif@@ f , who himself is a cancer surviv@@ or , who was saved by a clinical trial
this is the stat@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the-@@ art and how we do it .
you then have some body part descri@@ p@@ tions :
there &apos;s also a field of prote@@ om@@ ics that i &apos;ll talk about in a few minutes , which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classi@@ fying disease .
and i think that &apos;s been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have str@@ ived to understand cancer .
you know , i &apos;ve been using it for two and a half months .
reduce oc@@ curr@@ ence of cancer by a drug that doesn &apos;t even touch the cancer .
so the diseases we have today , which refl@@ ect patterns in the system over the last several decades , are going to change dra@@ ma@@ tically over the next decade or so based on things like this .
ten percent of people in the trial had this dra@@ matic response that was shown here , and the drug went to the f@@ da , and the f@@ da said , &quot; without a plac@@ e@@ bo , how do i know patients actually bene@@ f@@ ited from the drug ? &quot;
and so , a lot of what has been done with people like d@@ anny h@@ ill@@ is and others is to try to bring in engineering principles , try to bring the software .
juli@@ an tre@@ a@@ sure : the 4 ways sound aff@@ ects us
try and listen to the other one . we have a very small amount of band@@ wid@@ th for processing audit@@ ory input , which is why noise like this -- -- is extremely dama@@ ging for produc@@ tivity .
i &apos;ll give you two examples . most of you recognize that immediately .
it can be a bit like a bow@@ l of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti :
now , even at this stage , we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works .
does it have the substance to do it ?
now , of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys .
now , the circuit , you could also think of as the fabri@@ c of the brain .
so , let &apos;s switch it on . but to do it , what you have to do is you have to make this come alive .
ultimately it &apos;s got to be there if we stimul@@ ated it with it .
did i say that ? i guess i did .
tim worth says the economy is a wh@@ ol@@ ly@@ -@@ ow@@ ned sub@@ si@@ di@@ ary of the environment .
and as of just this week , last mon@@ day , google earth is now whole .
we &apos;re c@@ log@@ ging the ocean , pois@@ oning the planet &apos;s circul@@ atory system , and we &apos;re taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wil@@ d@@ life , all car@@ bon@@ -@@ based un@@ its .
natural systems on the land are in big trouble too , but the problems are more obvious , and some actions are being taken to protect trees , water@@ she@@ ds and wil@@ d@@ life .
we need many things to keep and maint@@ ain the world as a better place .
and one of the things we did at r@@ ad@@ bou@@ d university is we ap@@ point@@ ed a chi@@ ef listening off@@ ic@@ er .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
a month ago today i stood there :
and i said , &quot; you know , there &apos;s no doub@@ t if this bo@@ z@@ o can get across the desert , we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to . &quot;
they were our te@@ am@@ mat@@ es ! they were inspir@@ ing us .
this took place in my childhood -- 195@@ 7 to &apos; 65 .
it was the first project fun@@ ded by ar@@ pa .
it &apos;s quite dangerous , but i believe it &apos;s better to have dangerous things in the open than think you &apos;re going to keep them secret .
it &apos;s very low frequ@@ encies , it &apos;s basically like these sub@@ wo@@ of@@ ers .
that &apos;s the good news . the bad news is , when i got in contact with these people to try and get some documents from them , they went crazy because i had all this stuff that they don &apos;t have ,
something a bit more free , less con@@ str@@ ained . &quot;
our intuition is really fo@@ ol@@ ing us in a repe@@ at@@ able , predic@@ table , consist@@ ent way .
so i want to show you some cognitive illu@@ sions , or decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making illu@@ sions , in the same way .
so what are they doing ?
so a standard econom@@ ist , someone who believ@@ es in ration@@ ality , would say , &quot; you know what ? the cost of lif@@ ting the pen@@ cil and mar@@ king a v is higher than the possible benefit of the decision ,
very good for the physici@@ ans .
if you want coffee you have to pay for it yourself . it &apos;s two euro@@ s 50 .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don &apos;t know our pre@@ fer@@ ences that well .
in fact in medical terms , that &apos;s our view .
and one of the issues is capacity .
x-@@ r@@ ays , useful when you go to hospit@@ als .
yes .
and that signal is then conver@@ ted back to a high-@@ speed data stream .
and the answer is yes .
so the data goes in that direction , not there anymore .
and in the future , you would not only have 14 billion light bul@@ bs , you may have 14 billion li@@ -@@ f@@ is de@@ plo@@ yed worldwide -- for a clean@@ er , a green@@ er , and even a bri@@ ghter future .
a genome is really a description for all of the dna that is in a living organism .
well , now you ram@@ p that up to four , and you have a lot of complexity , a lot of ways to describe mechan@@ is@@ ms .
that &apos;s a tiny amount of material , but the way that ultimately ex@@ pr@@ esses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species .
some people will find very scar@@ y . i will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to proj@@ ec@@ tile pu@@ ke on me , but that &apos;s okay .
they have discovered path@@ ways that create fl@@ av@@ ors , although it &apos;s very important to understand that those com@@ pounds that it &apos;s cr@@ an@@ king out have to match a re@@ cep@@ tor in our genome , in our ton@@ gue , for us to understand and interpr@@ et those fl@@ av@@ ors .
this is not big news to vi@@ ti@@ cul@@ tur@@ ists ; they have been , you know , concerned with water and ferti@@ liz@@ ation .
now , we can create bad imp@@ acts -- we can pois@@ on ourselves ; we can pois@@ on the earth -- but that &apos;s just a natural out@@ come of a mistake we made .
and if we don &apos;t make that a reward in training , that will be a dis@@ tr@@ action .
the poor pu@@ pp@@ y ju@@ mps up , you open the dog book , what does it say ? &quot; hold his front pa@@ ws , squ@@ ee@@ ze his front pa@@ ws , st@@ amp on his h@@ ind feet , squ@@ ir@@ t him in the face with lem@@ on ju@@ ice , hit him on the head with a rol@@ le@@ d-@@ up newspaper , k@@ ne@@ e him in the ch@@ est , fli@@ p him over back@@ wards . &quot; because he grew ?
that will then become a reward for the lo@@ wer@@ -@@ frequ@@ ency behavior .
i was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago . and this was a dog that put both his o@@ wn@@ ers in hospital , plus the bro@@ ther@@ -@@ in-@@ law , plus the child .
not just with their pu@@ pp@@ y , but with the rest of the family at class .
this is how we go into a relationship , and it &apos;s hun@@ k@@ y-@@ d@@ ory for a year .
how on earth about rais@@ ing children ?
and so we &apos;re propos@@ ing a different kind of flexi@@ bility , something that we call &quot; com@@ part@@ ment@@ alized flexi@@ bility . &quot;
that &apos;s as it was given to us in all of its clar@@ ity and gl@@ ory .
it just so happens to be in the six@@ th through 10@@ th floor of the building , but that is not necessarily an expensive approach .
you &apos;ll have to tell me if i &apos;m going too fast for you .
it &apos;s almost as though the building could be placed anywhere : wher@@ ever you place it , the area underneath it is char@@ ged for the@@ a@@ tri@@ cal performan@@ ces .
they came to us and they said -- unlike normal develop@@ ers -- they said , &quot; we want to start out by provi@@ ding a contempor@@ ary art museum in lou@@ is@@ ville . that &apos;s our main goal . &quot;
now , within that center zone , as i said , we have the ability to mix a series of things .
w@@ k : this is my home . this is where i live .
w@@ k : i use a bicy@@ cle frame , and a pul@@ ley , and plastic pi@@ pe , what then pul@@ ls -- ca : do we have a picture of that ? can we have the next slide ?
w@@ k : yeah , if they can help me with materials , yeah .
there seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from , it gets ug@@ ly .
you can throw out crazy the@@ ories and not have to back it up with data or graph@@ s or research .
the size of the blo@@ b in this graph represents the size of the population ,
they &apos;ve all been combin@@ ed together in this technology .
but the difference is that these cultures never exp@@ and , never grow , never accumul@@ ate , never become combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
back in 19@@ 50 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average w@@ age to acqu@@ ire that much light .
and they did his sil@@ ly h@@ air@@ sty@@ les , or whatever .
and the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
and when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were ex@@ changing between groups .
the tas@@ mani@@ ans were isol@@ ated .
we &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
and in fact , this is one million plastic cu@@ ps , which is the number of plastic cu@@ ps that are used on air@@ line fli@@ ghts in the united states every six hours .
more than 4@@ 00,000 people die in the united states every year from smo@@ king ci@@ gar@@ ettes .
so , i made this image out of bar@@ bie dol@@ ls , and so , as you stand back you see this kind of flor@@ al pattern , and as you get all the way back , you see 3@@ 2,000 bar@@ bie dol@@ ls , which represents the number of breast augmentation surger@@ ies that are per@@ formed in the u.s. each month .
and it will prof@@ oun@@ dly affect the well-@@ being , the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to in@@ her@@ it the results of our decisions .
now , by the time we get out here to , let &apos;s say , ac@@ ute be@@ e paraly@@ sis virus -- probably a bad one to have if you &apos;re a be@@ e -@@ -- this virus shares almost no simil@@ ar@@ ity to co@@ x@@ sac@@ ki@@ ev@@ ir@@ us , but i can guar@@ an@@ te@@ e you that the se@@ quences that are most con@@ ser@@ ved among these viruses on the ri@@ ght-@@ hand of the screen are in identi@@ cal regi@@ ons right up here .
and , li@@ ke@@ wise , we infected them with par@@ ain@@ flu@@ enz@@ a-@@ 3 -- that &apos;s a param@@ y@@ x@@ o@@ virus -- and you see a little bar@@ code here .
well , it &apos;s pretty simple .
maybe they have kids . and then you can see , also , the family member that &apos;s related : r@@ s@@ v@@ b is showing up here .
they did a ct scan .
in fact , it &apos;s not even really se@@ qu@@ enced that much .
it &apos;s a classi@@ c gam@@ ma re@@ tro@@ virus , but it &apos;s totally new ; no one &apos;s ever seen it before .
&lt; transcript &gt;
until vol@@ ta , nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use .
it &apos;s f@@ it@@ ted with solid elec@@ tro@@ des and an elec@@ tr@@ ol@@ y@@ te that &apos;s a solution of sal@@ t and water .
it could be something like a wind farm .
that &apos;s 200 wat@@ t-@@ hours .
to develop liquid metal battery , i hi@@ red students and post-@@ do@@ cs and ment@@ o@@ red them .
from that point on , everything else was pretty much down@@ hill .
so as we eat , the camera starts pul@@ ling out , and then we start inter@@ acting with kind of larger and larger organisms .
and i &apos;ll also give it a few legs .
eventually they would go out into space , and start colon@@ izing and explor@@ ing the universe .
i can also play with the dynam@@ ics of this world over time .
let &apos;s fly to another one .
but we also have stars and things as well .
the world wide web ? not so sure .
well , it &apos;s ideas -- not wor@@ ms -- that hi@@ jack our brains .
now , this is a profound biological effect .
yesterday , ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te was talking about viral tele@@ communications but -- what &apos;s a virus ?
and , in principle , it could &apos;ve gone on forever ,
they are wi@@ ping out languages .
jac@@ quel@@ ine no@@ vo@@ grat@@ z applau@@ ds the world &apos;s he@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed interest in africa and poverty , but ar@@ gues persu@@ asi@@ vely for a new approach .
i had started a ba@@ k@@ ery with 20 un@@ wed mothers .
on a mac@@ ro level , four billion people on earth make less than four dollars a day .
you can &apos;t talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets , and i again give j@@ eff@@ re@@ y sa@@ ch@@ s of harvard huge ku@@ dos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life .
she runs two of the lines , and has already saved enough money to put a down pay@@ ment on her house .
my job depends upon it .
if you hold it too ti@@ ghtly , you cr@@ ush it .
south afri@@ cans just make music really fre@@ ely .
okay , we &apos;ll play it for you again now , and we &apos;re going to high@@ light , we &apos;re going to po@@ ke out the t , e , d .
the youn@@ g@@ est of my children was born with cer@@ ebr@@ al pal@@ sy , which as you can imagine , if you don &apos;t have an experience of it yourself , is quite a big thing to take on board .
clar@@ ence : i would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk .
well , the subject of difficult negoti@@ ation re@@ minds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east , of a man who left to his three sons 17 cam@@ els .
and yet , like many family re@@ uni@@ ons , it &apos;s not all peace and light .
that system , i call the &quot; third side . &quot;
and what we &apos;re here to do is not to talk about pu@@ er@@ to ri@@ co or the past .
and so my question is , yes , let &apos;s try and resol@@ ve the politics there in the middle east , but let &apos;s also take a look at the story .
what if that could be a vaccine against religious int@@ ol@@ er@@ ance ?
then we cross@@ ed the bor@@ der into sy@@ ri@@ a , went to al@@ e@@ pp@@ o , which , turns out , is named after abra@@ ham .
last month , there was a piece in the guar@@ di@@ an , in the man@@ ches@@ ter guar@@ di@@ an , about it -- two whole pages .
the path right now is like an ac@@ or@@ n ; it &apos;s still in its early phase .
if we &apos;re able to un@@ ite our thir@@ d-@@ side we@@ bs of peace , we can even hal@@ t the li@@ on of war .
and it starts with incredible kids like this , who come early and stay late .
and that is the youn@@ g@@ est nation@@ ally certi@@ fied work@@ force in america with our bronx bor@@ ough president .
really sch@@ ol@@ as@@ tic , if you ask me .
the green@@ est class in new york city .
how does it start ? well , look at jo@@ se &apos;s attention to detail .
black field , brown field , tox@@ ic waste field , batt@@ le@@ field -- we &apos;re pro@@ ving in the bronx that you can grow anywhere , on cement .
one got us invited to the white house , one &apos;s a recent incar@@ nation .
i &apos;ve got to say thank you to my wife and family , for my kids , thank you for coming every day , and for my colleagues , believ@@ ing and sup@@ porting me .
a means to deter@@ mine if there &apos;s a complete blo@@ ck@@ age of a cor@@ onary ar@@ ter@@ y .
and computers don &apos;t go to sleep .
your rhy@@ th@@ m becomes ir@@ regular , and that &apos;s what happened 45 minutes later .
it &apos;ll pick you up , and then we &apos;re going to call your doctor , tell him about it .
what does that mean ?
and that is the migr@@ aine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on .
that conclu@@ des my discussion of e@@ pil@@ ep@@ sy , which is the third invention that i want to discus@@ s here this after@@ noon .
engage a company having pri@@ or succ@@ esses for human fac@@ tors engineering and industrial design to opti@@ mi@@ ze the design of the first portable t@@ ms device that will be sold to the patients who have migr@@ aine head@@ aches .
however , if a video is there that everything was explained to you , and you have it all in the video file , it &apos;ll be much less likely that some hot@@ shot law@@ yer will take this case on contin@@ gency , because it won &apos;t be nearly as good a case .
when i was a little girl , my grand@@ father gave me his little sil@@ ver po@@ cket watch .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that i dra@@ g in to this magi@@ cal device within the device .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
and so we build for it in africa first and then we move to the ed@@ ges .
we think that we can actually create a crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced fil@@ ter .
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too bu@@ sy to sit with my dad and chat with him , and trade all those years for one hu@@ g .
in fact , so many different points of res@@ on@@ ance that it &apos;s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but i &apos;ll try to do my best .
so , liber@@ ating these pages and imagine di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing them and then stor@@ ing them in a vast , inter@@ connected , global re@@ pos@@ it@@ ory .
ok , what about people who are mix@@ ing ? what does &quot; mix@@ ing &quot; mean ?
if this book were to be published by a regular publi@@ sh@@ er , it would cost at least 1@@ 22 dollars .
and the thing that i realized is there was no way that i , as an engineer , could write this book that would get all of this across .
cli@@ cking on that logo takes you to an absolute no@@ -@@ non@@ sense , human@@ -@@ read@@ able document , a de@@ ed , that tells you exactly what you can do with this content .
ni@@ chol@@ as ne@@ gro@@ pon@@ te , foun@@ der of the mit media labor@@ atory , descri@@ bes how the one laptop per child project will build and distribu@@ te the &quot; $ 100 laptop . &quot;
because some people think that the $ 100 laptop just happened a year ago , or two years ago , or we were stru@@ ck by ligh@@ t@@ ning --
scre@@ w you . go to the back of the line and someone else will do it , and then when you figure out that this works , you can join as well .
well , no , it &apos;s not a laptop project . it &apos;s an education project .
now this people ask all the time what it is .
i &apos;m going to pass it to this hand@@ some gentlem@@ an .
we &apos;re pur@@ pos@@ ely not sig@@ ning anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones .
the answer is , the system certainly has software , but no , we &apos;re not provi@@ ding the education content .
so let &apos;s look at the concept of traditional anthropo@@ logy .
they have to go through their primary one , that &apos;s already aw@@ k@@ ward , and then they go through their second self &apos;s adol@@ escence ,
and so what happens is , when we bring all that into the social space , we end up chec@@ king our phones all the time .
why do teen@@ agers seem so much more impul@@ sive , so much less self-@@ aware than grow@@ n@@ -@@ u@@ ps ? cognitive neuro@@ scientist sar@@ ah@@ -@@ j@@ ay@@ ne bl@@ ak@@ emo@@ re compar@@ es the pre@@ frontal cortex in adol@@ escents to that of adults , to show us how typically “ teen@@ age ” behavior is caused by the growing and developing brain .
so i &apos;ll just give you an example from my lab .
the director , standing behind the set of shel@@ ves , is going to direct you to move objects around , but remember , he &apos;s not going to ask you to move objects
so there &apos;s a famous quote by shak@@ esp@@ ea@@ re from &quot; the winter &apos;s tale &quot; where he descri@@ bes adol@@ escence as fol@@ lows : &quot; i would there were no age between ten and three-@@ and-@@ tw@@ enty , or that you@@ th would sleep out the rest ; for there is nothing in the between but getting w@@ en@@ ches with child , wr@@ ong@@ ing the anci@@ en@@ try , ste@@ aling , fighting . &quot;
and you go into the town , and you in@@ qu@@ ire , &quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
9@@ 8 percent of babies are born hi@@ v@@ -@@ negative .
a nur@@ se in a bu@@ sy clin@@ ic will see 50 to 100 patients in a day , which leaves her just minutes per patient -- minutes per patient .
and then you &apos;re out on the street , and you don &apos;t know where to go . and you don &apos;t know who you can talk to , because the truth is , hiv is so sti@@ g@@ mati@@ zing that if you partner , your family , anyone in your home , you &apos;re likely to be thro@@ wn out without any means of support .
so the mothers who work for us , they come from the communities in which they work .
the father and the mother , together , they get the results .
and then this older sister stood up and said , &quot; i too am living with the virus , and i &apos;ve been ash@@ am@@ ed . &quot;
the care doesn &apos;t stop when the baby &apos;s born --
and last year , they en@@ rol@@ led 3@@ 00,000 hi@@ v@@ -@@ positive pregn@@ ant women and mothers .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trig@@ ger .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
the under@@ water part was cap@@ tured in a stone p@@ it .
you know , as for me , my wife and i have our own crazy leg@@ acy project .
you know , we carry so much bag@@ g@@ age , from our parents , from our society , from so many people -- f@@ ears , insec@@ u@@ ri@@ ties -- and our 200@@ -@@ year plan really li@@ sts all our childhood problems that we have to exp@@ ire .
at doing this . even when i make a painting , i actually imagine i &apos;m behind the painting ,
ne@@ tra and i don &apos;t write our 200@@ -@@ year plan for someone else to come and ex@@ ecu@@ te it in 150 years . imagine rece@@ iv@@ ing a par@@ c@@ el saying , from the past , okay now you &apos;re supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this . no .
i discovered the dark side of the industri@@ alized food system .
i decided that i &apos;d rather be an organic far@@ mer instead .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
mean@@ while , back at ted university , this wonderful woman is teaching you how to cho@@ p sun chi@@ ps .
the s@@ cales here are religi@@ os@@ ity from zero percent , or a@@ the@@ ist , to 100 percent , bible literally true .
and he and his team of j@@ uni@@ or@@ -@@ high school students were doing real science .
but the thing that i &apos;m really , really excited about is this incredible gran@@ o@@ la house .
so al , i actually think i &apos;m rather good at br@@ anding .
so we build this building on sti@@ l@@ ts , then up here -- is where we &apos;re going to put the new ste@@ in@@ bec@@ k audit@@ ori@@ um .
but over the years , 10 years later , the snow p@@ acks ero@@ ded , and , if you notice , the trees have started turning yellow .
i led three di@@ ving ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions to ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca .
but tell me where they are and the country that ow@@ ns them . &quot;
so i thought the scen@@ es of n@@ ever@@ -@@ ending wil@@ der@@ ness would go on forever ,
the islands rise only one to two meters above the surface .
and i was free for dinner , and i went out to dinner with the minister of fis@@ her@@ ies in ki@@ ri@@ bat@@ i .
so we had very strong leadership , very good vision and a lot of science , a lot of law@@ yers involved .
and it was a bot@@ tom@@ -up system , and that was very important with this work , from the bottom up to sec@@ ure this .
so this red line is the employ@@ ment@@ -@@ to-@@ population rati@@ o , in other words , the percentage of working age people in america who have work .
now , si@@ ri is far from perfect , and we can make fun of her f@@ laws , but we should also keep in mind that if technologies like si@@ ri and wat@@ son improve along a moore &apos;s law traj@@ ect@@ ory , which they will , in six years , they &apos;re not going to be two times better or four times better , they &apos;ll be 16 times better than they are right now .
there has been one story , one development in human history that b@@ ent the curve , b@@ ent it just about 90 degrees , and it is a technology story .
the lives of people , the wel@@ far@@ es of people , improve dra@@ ma@@ tically .
i know that it &apos;s incredibly boring to hear about other people &apos;s happ@@ in@@ esses .
under &quot; ni@@ r@@ van@@ a &quot; they showed this const@@ able painting .
so you &apos;re you &apos;re really bo@@ red in the sub@@ way , and you kind of st@@ are at something .
and that , as a result , my re@@ coup@@ able adv@@ ance from my lab@@ el will be taken from me ,
and then we did one more of these .
super@@ man is not only sent to earth from the heav@@ ens , or kr@@ yp@@ ton , but he &apos;s sent in a po@@ d , much like mo@@ ses was on the ni@@ le .
and 33 are spread between europe , the middle east and africa .
they &apos;re not allowed to individu@@ ally express who they are and what they are .
there &apos;s the powerful , the he@@ g@@ em@@ on@@ ous , the strong ,
didn &apos;t have a product , but had energy .
but the biggest thing we &apos;ve done to date , which is just amazing , is that we &apos;ve done a 2@@ 6@@ -@@ ep@@ is@@ ode anim@@ ated series , which is done for global audi@@ ences : in fact , we &apos;re already going to be in the u.s. and tur@@ key , we know .
don &apos;t we des@@ erve to be saved ? don &apos;t i ?
the second one was about a woman compl@@ aining because three min@@ iv@@ ans with six be@@ ar@@ ded men pulled up and started interro@@ g@@ ating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn &apos;t related to her .
you know , i think that there &apos;s a big par@@ alle@@ l between b@@ ending the cruci@@ fix out of shape and creating s@@ was@@ ti@@ k@@ as .
500 billion for this pi@@ pel@@ ine ,
1@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 00 billion .
and there may well be an up@@ sur@@ ge in the concer@@ n about their content .
you might want to get some chocol@@ ate in .
there &apos;s something almost quite magi@@ cal about visual information .
so massive , in fact , that it can cont@@ ain all the other military bud@@ gets in the world inside itself .
and if it can do that , maybe it can also change your behavior .
the data is all sto@@ red in a google do@@ c ,
often we can get clar@@ ity or the answer to a simple question very quickly ,
now what you are sm@@ elling is a combination of --
why doesn ’ t it smell of pot@@ ato@@ es or viol@@ ets ? well , there are really two the@@ ories .
a theory is something that en@@ ables you to do less work .
now , after se@@ arch@@ ing high and low for several months , i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a bor@@ ane which has exactly the same vibr@@ ation .
so here you have a system , you have something -- and there ’ s pl@@ enty of that stuff in biology -- some substance giving an elec@@ tron , and the elec@@ tron tries to jump , and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibr@@ ation does the reaction happen , ok ?
and the problem is it ’ s a car@@ cin@@ o@@ gen .
but we ’ re not actually doing it by as@@ tro@@ logy .
and what about terms like &quot; over the lim@@ it &quot; ?
so , how are we going to change the world ?
a few years ago i started developing lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electron@@ ics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with lit@@ t@@ le@@ bits as a material .
oli@@ ver tw@@ ist ; ca@@ ssi@@ a in &quot; the con@@ cu@@ b@@ ine of shanghai &quot; by hong ying ; cel@@ ie in al@@ ice wal@@ ker &apos;s &quot; the color pur@@ ple . &quot; all of these great fic@@ tional characters , all of them who were hur@@ t by their condition , all of them who s@@ pa@@ w@@ ned thousands of other books and other films , all of them were fo@@ ster@@ ed , adop@@ ted or or@@ phan@@ ed .
what happened then is a direct refl@@ ection of what is happening now . everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by god and by the state for the big society , fa@@ st-@@ trac@@ king adop@@ tion .
and what -- i should say this here , because this is how they engine@@ ered my leaving .
all of the staff were ex@@ -@@ police -- interesting -- and ex@@ -@@ prob@@ ation off@@ ic@@ ers .
hi . i &apos;m kevin al@@ loc@@ ca , i &apos;m the tr@@ ends man@@ ager at youtube , and i professi@@ on@@ ally watch youtube videos .
because ta@@ st@@ em@@ a@@ kers like j@@ im@@ my k@@ imm@@ el introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
someone made an old ti@@ me@@ y version . and then it went international .
&lt; transcript &gt;
now we come down to it , rel@@ atives gri@@ ev@@ ing . out in the hall with their cro@@ co@@ di@@ le t@@ ears ;
never suc@@ cu@@ m@@ b to the g@@ org@@ on &apos;s st@@ are .
what is gone is gone . now sleep .
even when on its worst behavior , i find myself automati@@ cally def@@ ending the us@@ a from the s@@ ne@@ ers of gre@@ en-@@ ey@@ ed euro@@ ph@@ iles playing their gre@@ ek card to rom@@ an tru@@ mps .
what of the temp@@ les of justice , whose serv@@ ants en@@ sl@@ ave us all ?
um , there are --
my friends , human nature is exactly the same as it was when my ancest@@ or -- probably it was my ancest@@ or -- got his hands around the nec@@ k of the last ne@@ ander@@ thal , and batter@@ ed the ba@@ st@@ ard to death .
the love of your son can ut@@ ter@@ ly transform anything he does .
this could be us .
and here &apos;s a very special moment , when my mother and myself were di@@ gg@@ ing up some re@@ mains of human ancest@@ ors . and it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re still trying to find answers to , and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species , and our ancest@@ ors are no exception .
some exciting fin@@ ds , again , as i mentioned , from d@@ man@@ is@@ i , in the re@@ public of ge@@ or@@ gi@@ a .
you can see here , again , taken from al gore &apos;s book . but what &apos;s happened is our technology has re@@ moved the chec@@ ks and bal@@ ances on our population growth .
the fronti@@ spi@@ e@@ ce of this article was this photo , and i &apos;m one of the people that thinks that tin@@ a brown was great for bringing photos to the new yor@@ ker , because this photo completely ro@@ cked my world .
this is someone selling this on e@@ bay ; it was clearly a woman ’ s hand , hopefully a woman &apos;s hand .
first of all , there &apos;s the object in the world .
so , i went down to my shop , and i mol@@ ded it and i cast it in res@@ in , because in the res@@ in , then , i could absolutely get the glass smo@@ oth finished .
and this thing , it &apos;s deeply , deeply satis@@ fying to me .
some 80 to 90 percent of under@@ sea creatures make light -- and we know very little about how or why . bi@@ olu@@ min@@ escence expert ed@@ ith wid@@ der explor@@ es this glo@@ wing , s@@ par@@ k@@ ling , lumin@@ ous world , sharing g@@ lor@@ i@@ ous images and insi@@ ght into the un@@ seen dep@@ ths of the ocean .
so , moun@@ ted in front of the observation sphere , there &apos;s a a three-@@ foot diam@@ eter ho@@ op with a screen stre@@ t@@ ched across it .
in fact , most of the people studying bi@@ olu@@ min@@ escence today are focused on the chemistry , because these chemicals have pro@@ ved so incredibly valuable for developing anti@@ bacter@@ ial agents , cancer fighting drugs , testing for the presence of life on mars , det@@ ecting pollu@@ t@@ ants in our wat@@ ers -- which is how we use it at or@@ ca .
it &apos;s got these je@@ wel@@ -@@ like light organs on its bel@@ ly that it uses for a type of ca@@ mou@@ fl@@ age that ob@@ liter@@ ates its sh@@ ado@@ w , so when it &apos;s swimming around and there &apos;s a predat@@ or looking up from below , it makes itself dis@@ appear .
and there are a lot of different animals that can do this :
it &apos;s this pin@@ whe@@ el of light ,
need@@ less to say , when it &apos;s k@@ lu@@ ged together like this , there were a lot of trials and tribu@@ l@@ ations getting this working .
i promise , you &apos;ll love it .
dna : design , nature , art . these are the three things that condition my world .
it felt like nothing . it has to feel like nothing .
i &apos;m not talking about designing tele@@ phones that look like that , and i &apos;m not looking at designing architecture like that .
it went into time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21@@ st century .
this is my art@@ work . this is all my process .
i have a big show with ph@@ illi@@ ps au@@ cti@@ on@@ e@@ ers .
they laugh@@ ed everywhere over the world i showed this .
i &apos;m trying to build fur@@ n@@ iture that fits architecture .
this is my studio . ele@@ phant sk@@ u@@ ll from oxford university , 198@@ 8 .
it &apos;s true . because there &apos;s a sou@@ l in this whole thing .
we are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
it was made of glass , and this building really helped me to do my job good .
i mean , it &apos;s a nice top@@ ic for a birth@@ day party or at the coffee machine , but to share this among your pe@@ ers is something different .
you can pass it around .
it &apos;s been there for three days , and it &apos;s l@@ aying on its back .
ne@@ il har@@ bis@@ son : i listen to color
and super@@ markets , i find this is very sho@@ cking , it &apos;s very , very attr@@ active to walk along a super@@ market .
it &apos;s not my fau@@ lt , because —
i think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body .
she was wh@@ ol@@ ly un@@ concerned about the be@@ ars , but she was terri@@ fied of law@@ yers .
and the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent , which is twice as much as in other countries
a culture per@@ v@@ aded with defen@@ si@@ ven@@ ess ,
we also surve@@ yed that . sev@@ ent@@ y-@@ eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in america have been thre@@ at@@ ened by their students with viol@@ ating their rights , with law@@ su@@ its by their students . they are thre@@ at@@ ening , their students .
well how do you fix it ? we could spend 10,000 life@@ times trying to pr@@ une this legal jun@@ gle .
but those same boun@@ dar@@ ies are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom .
and here is the har@@ dest and biggest change :
we &apos;ve been taught that authority is the enem@@ y of freedom .
we certainly can &apos;t trust the ban@@ kers , and we certainly can &apos;t trust the bro@@ kers .
and ken &#91; shar@@ pe &#93; and i certainly know that you need to re@@ ign in the ban@@ kers .
the way my co-@@ auth@@ or , ken , and i talk about it , they are kind of like jazz musici@@ ans . the rules are like the notes on the page , and that gets you started , but then you dance around the notes on the page , coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players .
he had never commit@@ ted a crime before .
she found her@@ self listening to a con@@ sul@@ tant one day who was trying to help teachers boo@@ st the test s@@ cor@@ es of the kids , so that the school would reach the el@@ ite categ@@ ory in percentage of kids pass@@ ing big tests .
if you reward kids for reading books , they stop car@@ ing about what &apos;s in the books and only care about how long they are .
but ju@@ dge rus@@ sell did have an alternative .
ban@@ king hasn &apos;t always been the way we read about it now in the newsp@@ ap@@ ers .
indeed , we argue , there is no sub@@ stitu@@ te for wisdom .
we began to counter@@ -@@ pro@@ lif@@ er@@ ate , and we dro@@ pped the number of nuclear war@@ heads in the world to about a total of 21@@ ,000 .
this was basically an attempt to teach our scho@@ ol@@ children that if we did get engag@@ ed in a nuclear confron@@ tation and atom@@ ic war , then we wanted our school children to kind of basically du@@ ck and cover .
so organizations like physici@@ ans for social responsibility , around 197@@ 9 , started saying this a lot publi@@ c@@ ly .
how much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10@@ -@@ kil@@ ot@@ on bomb ?
and they &apos;re re@@ tal@@ i@@ ation@@ -@@ pro@@ of .
anybody who dis@@ mis@@ ses the thought of a nuclear wea@@ pon being used by a terror@@ ist is kid@@ ding themselves .
you have , when the bl@@ ast goes off -- and by the way , if it ever comes up , don &apos;t look at it .
and i just want to leave you with the personal points that i think you might be interested in .
this was sent to me by somebody who is an af@@ ici@@ on@@ a@@ do of civil defen@@ se proce@@ du@@ res , but the fact of the matter is that america &apos;s gone through a very hard time .
and he told me , &quot; bio@@ sig@@ natu@@ res , we need to look for a bio@@ signature . &quot;
if you take the lesson of all these pictures , then you realize , well actually maybe it &apos;s not that easy .
why ? because these things don &apos;t evol@@ ve by themselves .
and these kinds of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves .
and i &apos;m telling you , this is very robu@@ st across english tex@@ ts .
now you could ask : well , what about these av@@ idi@@ ans ? the av@@ idi@@ ans being the den@@ iz@@ ens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy repli@@ c@@ ating and growing in complexity .
now the vi@@ ability th@@ res@@ hold is reach@@ ed , and the frequ@@ ency distribution has dra@@ ma@@ tically changed and , in fact , stabi@@ liz@@ es .
and if we re@@ move the myster@@ y of life , then i think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live , and how perhaps we &apos;re not as special as we always think we are .
and that really , really exc@@ ites me .
he knew , in i@@ rel@@ and , that his son would live ,
even the poor@@ est neighbor@@ ho@@ ods give more than they can afford .
every week , religious extrem@@ ists take another african village .
these things are under attack around the world .
it is the flo@@ wer@@ ing of the see@@ ds you plan@@ ted in earlier , hea@@ di@@ er days .
we &apos;re calling it the one campaign .
and you , at this conference , are in a unique position .
i should add that this started out as a much longer list of w@@ ish@@ es .
actually we &apos;re talking to ab@@ c today about the os@@ cars .
that is my wish , my third wish .
we ut@@ ter about six met@@ ap@@ hors a minute .
what we see , however , are two over@@ l@@ apping tri@@ angles .
if you &apos;re like most people , you will experience a moment of cognitive dis@@ son@@ ance when the name of the color is print@@ ed in a differently colo@@ red ink .
inter@@ ven@@ e , app@@ eal to the u.n. , or do nothing ?
the mind is a plastic snow dom@@ e , the most beautiful , most interesting , and most itself , when , as el@@ vis put it , it &apos;s all sho@@ ok up .
in ballo@@ oning , or in life , how do we change altitude ?
thro@@ wing over@@ board , as ball@@ ast , to change our direction . well , these basically are things i believed in such a long time .
and actually this is where the adv@@ enture really started .
it takes too much energy . it will cost too much .
and with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane , we can produce the same energy than 200 little ligh@@ t@@ bul@@ bs .
so , you see that this airplane is more a symbo@@ l .
which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life , to get to the success that you wish to have , to get to the point that really bel@@ on@@ gs to you , with the potential you have , and the one you can really ful@@ fill ?
obviously , there &apos;s always the dark side of it .
and i went back home and i said , &quot; d@@ ad@@ dy , i don &apos;t know who i am .
so how have you de@@ al@@ t with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you ?
and very , very difficult times .
and it definitely does give a different image of y@@ em@@ en .
no , i &apos;m just jo@@ king .
in 2003 , after my studies , it was b@@ ann@@ ed in the european union , but in that same year , the united states ep@@ a re-@@ reg@@ is@@ tered the com@@ pound .
it &apos;s a com@@ pound that &apos;s found in poly@@ car@@ bon@@ ate plastic , which is what baby bot@@ tles are made out of .
and as a result , when those rats grow up , their pu@@ ps experience re@@ tar@@ ded growth and development because they can &apos;t make enough milk to nour@@ ish their pu@@ ps .
we are in effect pollu@@ ting our children .
the problem is , in my village , o@@ ak@@ land , in most of our villages , we don &apos;t see that connection .
she said , &quot; those high notes are going to kill you . &quot;
and it &apos;s not a particularly pre@@ fer@@ able medicine in many sen@@ ses .
but his -- well , the only way i can arti@@ cul@@ ate how it felt was that it preci@@ pit@@ ated my medical decline .
i wanted to live .
during the thir@@ te@@ en-@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ hour surgery , i fl@@ at@@ lin@@ ed twice , 40 quar@@ ts of blood were inf@@ used into my body .
this past summer , when i was running and singing and d@@ ancing and playing with my ni@@ eces and my ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws and my brothers and my s@@ ist@@ ers and my mother and my grandmother in the color@@ a@@ do rock@@ ies , i couldn &apos;t help but think of that doctor who told me that i couldn &apos;t sing .
half of each year &apos;s 100 billion points of ther@@ mal plastic p@@ ell@@ ets will be made into fa@@ st-@@ track tr@@ ash .
i off@@ ered five cents each for bottle cap@@ s .
the thro@@ w@@ away society cannot be con@@ ta@@ ined -- it has gone global .
my first connection with the news media was in 198@@ 4 , the b@@ bc had a one-@@ day stri@@ ke .
any event that happens anywhere in the world , i should be able to know about it pretty much inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously , as it happens , for free .
and it &apos;s an amazing way of visu@@ aliz@@ ing the conversation , but what you get is h@@ ints at who is more interesting and who is worth investi@@ g@@ ating .
so if you look in the video , there &apos;s the big um@@ b@@ rel@@ la , there &apos;s a white li@@ lo in the po@@ ol , there are some un@@ usually r@@ ounded ed@@ ges in the swimming po@@ ol , and there &apos;s two trees in the background .
we &apos;re looking for one that cro@@ sses ea@@ st-@@ west .
richard pres@@ ton on the giant trees
think about this tree , ris@@ ing up@@ ward into red@@ wood space , 3@@ 25 feet , 32 stories , an individual living organism arti@@ cul@@ ating its forms up@@ ward into space over long peri@@ ods of time .
and i began clim@@ bing trees with my kids as just something to do with them , using the so@@ -@@ called ar@@ bor@@ ist clim@@ bing technique , with ro@@ pes . you use ro@@ pes to get yourself up into the cro@@ wn of a tree .
these are hu@@ ck@@ le@@ ber@@ ry bu@@ sh@@ es .
i &apos;ve wanted to ask crai@@ g v@@ enter if it would be possible to in@@ sert a syn@@ thetic chromosome into a human so that we could re@@ it@@ er@@ ate ourselves if we wanted to .
we &apos;re looking at the very top of g@@ ay@@ a , which is thought to be the ol@@ dest red@@ wood .
explor@@ ing with them the forest canop@@ y has been one of the most lo@@ vely things of my existence on earth .
it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos i took while i was in pakistan .
you know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
so you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing google sear@@ ches .
i mean , the internet is international .
that code is there underneath the en@@ cr@@ y@@ ption as some sort of a signature .
so what happens when online crimin@@ als are caught ?
it &apos;s actually very basic stuff -- thinking about continu@@ ity , thinking about back@@ u@@ ps , thinking about the things that actually matter .
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict , and there are some that it can &apos;t .
that person surr@@ ounds himself or her@@ self with ad@@ vis@@ ers .
so i &apos;m going to talk to you about how to process it , and i &apos;m going to give you some examples out of iran , and you &apos;re going to be wondering , &quot; why should we listen to this guy ?
that &apos;s the basic stuff an expert needs to know .
these guys are all sh@@ r@@ inking , the power is all dri@@ f@@ ting out here , so the out@@ come is going to be the wea@@ pon@@ s-@@ grade fuel . who are the win@@ ners and who are the lo@@ s@@ ers in iran ?
ca : so you &apos;re kind of trying to say , &quot; people of iran , this is your des@@ tiny , lets go there . &quot;
i don &apos;t know about another categ@@ ory , but we all know how to think .
and the reason is , it &apos;s about appreci@@ ation and it &apos;s about contribu@@ tion . you can only feel so much by yourself .
and what i mean specifically , rather than just some phrase , is if you have emotion , human emotion , something that i experienced from you a day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as i &apos;ve ever experienced , and if you &apos;d communic@@ ated with that emotion i believe you would have beat his ass and won .
audience : ay@@ e . t@@ r : so the bottom line is , maybe it was where to go to work , and you met the love of your life there .
which , i believe -- it &apos;s not your des@@ ires .
third human need , critical : signific@@ ance . we all need to feel important , special , unique . you can get it by making more money .
because the six@@ th need is to contribu@@ te beyond ourselves .
i &apos;d say one of the parts of the map is like time . some people &apos;s idea of a long time is 100 years . somebody else &apos;s is three seconds , which is what i have .
and the integr@@ ation that happened is on a film , which i &apos;ll be happy to send you , so you can really see what actually happened instead of my ver@@ b@@ alization of it ,
they want to teach me about my des@@ tiny .
now science may dis@@ miss this me@@ tho@@ do@@ logy , but poly@@ nes@@ ian navig@@ ators use it today because it provi@@ des them an accur@@ ate deter@@ min@@ ation of the angle and direction of their ves@@ sel .
and i am re@@ min@@ ded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast su@@ ms of knowledge in them , as po@@ tent as the mic@@ ron@@ es@@ ian navig@@ ators , that are going dis@@ miss@@ ed , that this is a tes@@ tam@@ ent to brilliant , brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is van@@ ishing rapidly .
because son@@ y music had reg@@ is@@ tered chris brown &apos;s video in our content id system , within seconds of attemp@@ ting to u@@ plo@@ ad the video , the copy was det@@ ected , giving son@@ y the choice of what to do next .
this is their we@@ d@@ ding video .
there &apos;s lots of cases where we have more than one work ma@@ shed together .
i &apos;d like to play to you guys , if you &apos;re willing to be the first audience to hear it .
since the d@@ a@@ wn of human history , we &apos;ve tried to rec@@ ti@@ fy this im@@ balance by making art , writing po@@ ems , singing son@@ gs , scri@@ p@@ ting ed@@ it@@ ori@@ als and sending them in to a newspaper , go@@ ssi@@ ping with friends . this is nothing new .
mur@@ murs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ce@@ iling .
me@@ tric@@ s provi@@ des more nu@@ mer@@ ical vie@@ ws on the data .
so as you can see , we feel fine uses a technique that i call &quot; pas@@ sive observation . &quot;
you know , as a child in ver@@ m@@ ont , on a farm where i grew up , i would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star bel@@ t of or@@ ion , the hun@@ ter .
this is the universe of 2007 , the last two months .
you can see that this is an important story ; there are a lot of things in its or@@ bit . if we open this up , we get different perspec@@ tives on this story .
and@@ ers yn@@ ner@@ man : visu@@ aliz@@ ing the medical data explosion
and just assu@@ me that we will be collec@@ ting data during five seconds , and that would correspond to one ter@@ ab@@ y@@ te of data --
she &apos;s only two years old , and she &apos;s having a bl@@ ast .
and of course all the data is inside , so i can start rot@@ ating , i can look at it from different angles , and i can see that this woman had a problem .
without saying too much about this case , this is a traffic accident , a dr@@ un@@ k driver hit a woman .
so we &apos;ve impl@@ ement@@ ed all the ges@@ tures you can do on the table , and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface .
and this is also due to these fantastic new scann@@ ers , that just in 0@@ .@@ 3 seconds , i can scan the whole heart , and i can do that with time resol@@ ution .
and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activ@@ ated on the motor cortex .
so this is a li@@ on from the local zo@@ o outside of nor@@ r@@ k@@ op@@ ing in k@@ ol@@ mar@@ den , el@@ sa .
ne@@ il tu@@ ro@@ k makes his ted prize wish
i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible , to try to connect the academ@@ ic stuff with the real world .
and , ad@@ mit@@ ted@@ ly , it &apos;s in a very shor@@ th@@ and not@@ ation .
which is , what happens if these two , three-@@ dimensional worlds should actually colli@@ de ?
what about those kids i &apos;d left behind ?
but i learned that there was a des@@ per@@ ate shor@@ t@@ age of skills , especially mathematical skills , in industry , in government , in education .
and so when word came out that aims was opening , it spread very quickly via e-@@ mail and our website .
so here is where we were after the first gradu@@ ation in 2004 .
he &apos;s about to finish his ph@@ .@@ d@@ . , and he was fil@@ med recently with someone you all know .
we want to use science to over@@ come the national and cultural barri@@ ers , as it does at aims .
&lt; transcript &gt;
so that &apos;s true love , right there .
whereas this is par@@ alle@@ l and it &apos;s flu@@ id .
these are your ones , but you &apos;ve got a few zer@@ os thro@@ wn in .
so if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clo@@ b@@ ber@@ ed , it doesn &apos;t show up over here , these two pieces can activ@@ ate the missing part with these red@@ un@@ dant connections .
and it extr@@ acts regi@@ ons with white or light contr@@ ast , which will show up on the video as green .
do you put together in your mind the work you &apos;re doing , the future of africa , this conference -- what connections can we make , if any , between them ?
so , to begin with , we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the pro@@ of of a black hole .
so , now we know what a sch@@ war@@ z@@ s@@ child radi@@ us is .
i like to call these the prim@@ a donn@@ a of the galaxy world , because they are kind of show off@@ s .
so , we can see far more detail in our galaxy than any@@ place else .
in other words , just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is cent@@ ered on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is .
but with this experiment , we &apos;ve con@@ fin@@ ed that same mass to a much smaller volume that &apos;s 10,000 times smaller .
it pul@@ ls much str@@ onger on one side than the other and the cloud is stri@@ pped apart .
and this means that these things do exist in our universe , and we have to con@@ tend with this , we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world .
the real key observation he made is that a fre@@ e-@@ flying wing can swe@@ ep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fix@@ e@@ d-@@ wing tur@@ b@@ ine .
if you &apos;d lo@@ an me your gul@@ f@@ stream , i &apos;ll ri@@ p its wings off and generate you a me@@ ga@@ wat@@ t .
it &apos;s a phenomenon that i think any organization or individual can ta@@ p into .
well , i think it &apos;s the lat@@ est it@@ er@@ ation of a phenomenon we can call &quot; crow@@ d-@@ acceler@@ ated innovation . &quot;
but the desire el@@ ement is really di@@ al@@ ed way up .
we are learning from them .
here , let me introduce you to sa@@ m hab@@ er .
well , so , there &apos;s some showing as well as telling .
now , ted is just a small part of this .
here &apos;s a group of kids in a village in pakistan near where i grew up .
guys , we &apos;ve learned from you today .
well , because mr. anderson told me that this session is called &quot; syn@@ c and flow , &quot; i was wondering , &quot; what do i know that these geni@@ uses don &apos;t ? &quot;
you feel like you &apos;re on top of your game and you can do anything you want .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
now , while ... while you &apos;re push@@ ing the clock , there &apos;s a few rules to o@@ be@@ y .
you only have to make one decision , and that is : are you going to use the white version for very good ted@@ talks , about creativity , human geni@@ us ?
but if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being -- things like your family relationships , friend@@ ship , community , values -- then , actually , this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics .
suddenly , all sorts of transport , travel information were possible , and this gave birth to , what i like to call , the bure@@ au@@ cratic age .
anyone thinking , &quot; i could do that service better , i could deliver it che@@ aper , &quot; it &apos;s all available there .
well , we &apos;ve had government information campaig@@ ns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home .
we have personal computing , why not personal bi@@ ot@@ ech ? that ’ s the question biolog@@ ist ell@@ en j@@ or@@ gen@@ sen and her colleagues asked themselves before opening gen@@ space , a non@@ profit di@@ y@@ bi@@ o lab in bro@@ ok@@ ly@@ n dev@@ ot@@ ed to citiz@@ en science , where am@@ ateurs can go and tin@@ ker with bi@@ otechno@@ logy . far from being a sin@@ ister fran@@ ken@@ ste@@ in &apos;s lab , gen@@ space off@@ ers a long list of fun , creative and practical uses for di@@ y@@ bi@@ o .
more regul@@ ations , less resources .
now , we follow state and local regul@@ ations . we dis@@ pose of our waste proper@@ ly , we follow safety proce@@ du@@ res , we don &apos;t work with patho@@ gens .
you can send weather ballo@@ ons up into the str@@ ato@@ sphere , collect microbes , see what &apos;s up there .
and for hundreds , even thousands of years , the home was really the center of life .
you have — cities are where most of the wealth is created , and particularly in the developing world , it &apos;s where women find opportunities . that &apos;s
we think of it as a comp@@ act urban cell .
this was a video that was on european television last week showing the sp@@ an@@ ish minister of industry driving this little vehicle , and when it &apos;s fol@@ ded , it can sp@@ in .
you have a conventi@@ onal one-@@ be@@ dro@@ om arrang@@ ement when you need it . maybe that &apos;s most of the time .
we think these little wi@@ reless sens@@ ors are more effective .
some say bigger .
and then they &apos;d to@@ w the sharks back to pur@@ te@@ en har@@ b@@ or , bo@@ il them up , use the oil .
and this represents their hab@@ it of bas@@ king on the surface when the sun is out .
half the challenge is to get access , is to be in the right place at the right time .
one thing that i think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks are .
i don &apos;t understand this . i don &apos;t pre@@ tend to understand this .
this is a shark that was actually land@@ ed in how@@ th just before christ@@ mas , il@@ leg@@ ally , because you &apos;re not allowed to do that under e@@ .@@ u@@ . law , and was actually sold for eight euro@@ s a kil@@ o as shark stea@@ k .
it was only because we had a conference on the is@@ le of man .
and what you &apos;re trying to look at is the males have clas@@ pers , which kind of d@@ angle out behind the back of the shark .
interes@@ t@@ ingly , i asked this question when i was a little kid .
to int@@ enti@@ on@@ ally har@@ m people psycho@@ log@@ ically , to hur@@ t people physi@@ cally , to destro@@ y people mor@@ t@@ ally , or ideas , and to comm@@ it cri@@ mes against humanity .
so they &apos;re going to put pressure on these soldiers , military police , to cross the line , give them permission to break the will of the enem@@ y , to pre@@ pare them for interro@@ gation , to sof@@ ten them up , to take the glo@@ ves off . those are the eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ ms , and this is how it was inter@@ pre@@ ted .
so if you want to change a person , you &apos;ve got to change the situation .
the lear@@ ner &apos;s a gen@@ ial , midd@@ le-@@ aged guy .
mil@@ gram did more than 16 studies . and look at this . in study 16 , where you see somebody like you go all the way , 90 percent go all the way . in study five , if you see people re@@ bel , 90 percent re@@ bel .
student : a police car pul@@ ls up in front , and a co@@ p comes to the front door , and kno@@ cks , and says he &apos;s looking for me .
so this anthropo@@ logist , john wat@@ son , found 23 cultures that had two bits of data .
and he goes on to say , &quot; the land@@ mark stanford study provi@@ des a cau@@ tion@@ ary tale for all military oper@@ ations . &quot;
and our kids &apos; heroes are also role models for them , because they have super@@ natural talents .
and i want to end with the story that some of you know , about wes@@ ley aut@@ re@@ y , new york sub@@ way hero .
ant@@ on@@ i@@ o dama@@ si@@ o : the qu@@ est to understand consciousness
the colors are co@@ des for the direction , from whether it is back to front or vice ver@@ sa .
this , of course , is a visual map that i &apos;m showing you , but this appli@@ es to any kind of map -- audit@@ ory , for example , in relation to sound frequ@@ encies , or to the maps that we constru@@ ct with our skin in relation to an object that we pal@@ p@@ ate .
so it provi@@ des certain areas for perception and imag@@ e-@@ making . and those are exactly the same that are going to be used for imag@@ e-@@ making when we rec@@ all information .
so here &apos;s how it looks . look at the region there .
they &apos;re there because there &apos;s this very close interaction .
why care if it is the brain stem or the cer@@ ebr@@ al cortex and how this is made ?
and i &apos;ve decided , for me , it &apos;s been a real journey and parado@@ x .
but it looks very different .
which brings me to the second parado@@ x : so@@ ber@@ ing up about our small@@ ness and maint@@ aining faith in our great@@ ness all at once .
i wrote about em@@ ily ap@@ t who initi@@ ally became a ca@@ se@@ wor@@ ker in the wel@@ f@@ are system because she decided that was the most no@@ ble thing she could do , but quickly learned , not only did she not like it , but she wasn &apos;t really good at it .
it &apos;s about embr@@ ac@@ ing the parado@@ x .
today we &apos;re often too bu@@ sy tend@@ ing to our i@@ phones and ipo@@ ds to really stop and get to know ourselves .
these br@@ ain@@ waves are being analy@@ zed and we can see them as a graph .
we were making things activ@@ ate , light up and work just by thinking .
so the goal of the original game zen b@@ ound is to w@@ ra@@ p a ro@@ pe around a woo@@ den form .
so you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and impro@@ ving their add symp@@ tom@@ s as they do it .
two mill@@ en@@ nia ago , those gre@@ e@@ ks had some powerful insi@@ ghts .
not that we could have affor@@ ded i drive , but to give me the dream of driving .
the really strange part is that , at three and a half , just before i was going to school , my parents made a bizarre , unusual and incredibly br@@ ave decision .
and then i went in and i got a global con@@ sul@@ ting job with ac@@ cent@@ ure . and they didn &apos;t even know .
have you ever tried to see that if you have vas@@ el@@ ine in front of your eyes ?
and my ch@@ est ach@@ ed .
do something different . what do you want to be ?
but you know , i was believ@@ ing in the wrong thing .
and so here i am .
you can call it a techno@@ sis ex@@ tern@@ ality clu@@ ster@@ fu@@ ck .
you know , in these places in other cultures , people just go there volun@@ tar@@ ily because they like them . we don &apos;t have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here . you know , you don &apos;t have to have a k@@ wan@@ z@@ a@@ a f@@ es@@ tiv@@ al . people just go because it &apos;s plea@@ sur@@ able to be there .
the message is : we don &apos;t give a fu@@ ck ! we don &apos;t give a fu@@ ck .
the street trees have really four jobs to do and that &apos;s it :
please respect us , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal .
and we should have started two days before yesterday .
and america &apos;s not prepared .
we &apos;re not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .
video : three , two , one , go !
and so as we move out , we see continu@@ ously from our planet all the way out into the re@@ al@@ m of galaxies , as we see here , ligh@@ t-@@ travel time , giving you a sense of how far away we are .
we &apos;re actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-@@ sahar@@ an plan@@ et@@ ari@@ um in ghana as well as new libr@@ aries that have been built in the gh@@ et@@ to@@ s in colum@@ bia and a high school in cam@@ bo@@ dia .
and i &apos;d add to that , that it &apos;s not just making it , but everybody , each of us , everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way , and that &apos;s one of the main parts of my work .
if you haven &apos;t seen it , it &apos;s worth reading . he &apos;s a pi@@ an@@ ist himself , and he details his whole career of looking at and obser@@ ving incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peop@@ les &apos; lives in unusual situations .
and it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , who wants to live forever .
and i &apos;d like now to invite two very special people on the stage , so that i can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like .
what types of things does he find important to control and con@@ ve@@ y in a piece of music ?
so , in hearing this piece , as i mentioned before , the most important thing is the music &apos;s great , and it &apos;ll show you who dan is .
but there were problems .
there was this hero , o@@ dy@@ ss@@ eus , who &apos;s hea@@ ding back home after the tro@@ j@@ an war .
because there &apos;s two heads inside one person when you think about it .
now i &apos;m a big fan of commit@@ ment devices actually .
the more you exercise it , the str@@ onger it gets .
but aren &apos;t there things that we believe and don &apos;t believe at the same time ?
some of them look like places i lived in as a graduate student .
and slowly , slowly we &apos;re bringing it up to a moder@@ ate sav@@ ings rate .
i want you to imagine this for a moment . two men , ra@@ hu@@ l and ra@@ ji@@ v , living in the same neighborhood , from the same edu@@ ca@@ tional background , similar occu@@ pation , and they both turn up at their local accident emer@@ gency compl@@ aining of ac@@ ute ch@@ est pain .
it &apos;s this in@@ justice that has really driven my mission to try to do a little bit to transform the lives of people affected by mental ill@@ ness , and a particularly critical action that i focused on is to bridge the gulf between the knowledge we have that can transform lives , the knowledge of effective treat@@ ments , and how we actually use that knowledge in the everyday world .
it seems to me that there are five key lessons that i &apos;ve shown on this slide that are cri@@ tically important for effective task shif@@ ting .
i began my life as a markets professional and continu@@ ed to take an interest , but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature , and which doesn &apos;t get pr@@ ic@@ ed by the markets .
and the answer is z@@ il@@ ch , exactly zero .
because these are important benefits for the poor .
and if you see the benefits of the mang@@ ro@@ ve in terms of the stor@@ m protection and cy@@ cl@@ one protection that you get and in terms of the fis@@ her@@ ies , the fish nur@@ series , that provide fish for the poor , that answer is more like $ 1@@ 1,000 .
and the world bank has ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ged this and they &apos;ve started a project called waves -- wealth accoun@@ ting and valu@@ ation of ecosystem services .
the other favorite , if you like , solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets .
so that &apos;s almost an ei@@ gh@@ th of society .
he was a philosop@@ her ;
they took him for lunch to a sandwich place in pas@@ ad@@ ena .
can you build a machine that thinks like a human being , that is conscious ?
and he was curious .
but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father .
he would try to visu@@ alize it , gu@@ ided by a small number of simple principles .
they &apos;re difficult integr@@ als .
thank you .
com@@ poun@@ ding that , the material of choice , lam@@ in@@ ate , that i was trying to high@@ light , only b@@ ends in two dimensions .
i thought , &quot; finally , oh yeah great , big company , i &apos;m g@@ onn@@ a work with somebody with money for to@@ ol@@ ing and mol@@ ding . &quot;
so where does this tr@@ end stop ?
these are in@@ u@@ it children cutting wh@@ ale blu@@ b@@ ber .
it &apos;s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on it@@ unes , write it to a c@@ d , then ri@@ p the c@@ d to an mp@@ 3 and play it on your very same computer .
so with that , let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mo@@ od of what we &apos;re trying to explain .
there &apos;s not enough young , healthy people falling off their mot@@ or@@ cycle and don@@ ating that tissue to us .
well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
from a met@@ e@@ or@@ ite from space , we ’ re over here with an original s@@ put@@ ni@@ k .
and so all of western europe started buying print@@ ing pr@@ esses in 14@@ 55 -- to print out thousands , and then hundreds of thousands , and then ultimately millions of single , small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heav@@ en .
how do we create ?
we think about the internet ;
i &apos;m going to play it for you in a couple minutes , but i want to make an analo@@ g@@ y before i do to this .
because i have some limited time , i &apos;ll cut it off for a second , and tell you about how it works and what it &apos;s good for .
and hopefully they &apos;ll be sensitive that they don &apos;t want to off@@ end you with just one more out@@ let .
lin@@ ear@@ ity means higher quality sound .
and so , another way of hopefully deter@@ min@@ ing who &apos;s friend@@ ly and who isn &apos;t .
i usually figure out what my talk is when i get up in front of a group .
i became bizar@@ rely popular .
so here &apos;s the word puzzle again .
okay , well , it &apos;s what i can do with some house@@ hold tin@@ fo@@ il .
it didn &apos;t exactly work out that way .
i don &apos;t have that much else to say , but they turned out really well .
and i actually really feel that it &apos;s wor@@ th@@ while to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way .
let &apos;s play a little .
inspired by an ab@@ alone sh@@ ell , angel@@ a bel@@ cher programs viruses to make el@@ eg@@ ant nan@@ os@@ cale structures that humans can use . sel@@ ecting for high-@@ per@@ forming genes through direc@@ ted evolution , she &apos;s produced viruses that can constru@@ ct powerful new batteries , clean hydrogen fu@@ els and recor@@ d-@@ breaking solar cells . at tedx@@ cal@@ tech , she shows us how it &apos;s done .
so when we think about future technologies , we actually think of using bacteria and virus , simple organisms .
here &apos;s the dna sequence , here &apos;s the protein sequence in order to do it . &quot; and so an interesting idea is , what if you could take any material that you wanted , or any el@@ ement on the peri@@ o@@ di@@ c table , and find its correspon@@ ding dna sequence , then code it for a correspon@@ ding protein sequence to build a structure , but not build an ab@@ alone sh@@ ell -- build something that , through nature , it has never had the opportunity to work with yet .
and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all gene@@ tically identi@@ cal , but they diff@@ er from each other based on their ti@@ ps , on one sequence that co@@ des for one protein .
and then we give it a second gene to grow an in@@ organic material that can be used to sp@@ lit water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fu@@ els .
and so these companies , they build off@@ ices .
it &apos;s like the front door of the office is like a cuis@@ in@@ art , and you walk in and your day is sh@@ re@@ dded to bits , because you have 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there , and then something else happens and you &apos;re pulled off your work , and you &apos;ve got to do something else , then you have 20 minutes , then it &apos;s lunch .
now , there are different kinds of dis@@ tr@@ actions , but there aren &apos;t the really bad kinds of dis@@ tr@@ actions that i &apos;ll talk about in just a minute .
and if you talk to certain manag@@ ers , they &apos;ll tell you that they don &apos;t want their employees to work at home because of these dis@@ tr@@ actions .
those are the real problems in the modern office today .
me@@ et@@ ings are places to go to talk about things you &apos;re supposed to be doing later .
so just the after@@ noon , one th@@ ur@@ s@@ day .
today &apos;s fri@@ day -- so mon@@ day , usually people have me@@ et@@ ings on mon@@ day .
and that &apos;s , kind of , where i see what my job is and what our team &apos;s job is .
so , keys provide an access to shel@@ ter and war@@ m@@ th -- transport as well , in the u.s. increasingly .
and you turn around , and you look back into the space , and some people talk al@@ oud .
and the fact is that millions of people do it .
there &apos;s a second thing i like about this .
i &apos;m not going to answer that , ok .
if you want a big idea , you need to embr@@ ace everyone on the planet , that &apos;s the first thing .
&quot; the stre@@ tch . &quot; ok , the gentlem@@ an on the left is saying , &quot; scre@@ w you , i &apos;m going to check my device . &quot; but the guy , here , on the right ,
one way to change our genes is to make new ones , as crai@@ g v@@ enter has so el@@ eg@@ antly shown .
how sex@@ y is that ?
and then i went home that night , and i had an even larger emotional mel@@ t@@ down , which i &apos;ll say more about in a minute .
and second of all , it requires imagination .
the re@@ main@@ ing regre@@ ts per@@ tain to these things : finance , family issues un@@ related to rom@@ ance or par@@ ent@@ ing , health , friends , spiritu@@ ality and community .
we can &apos;t identify with that part .
now there is a case to be made that control fre@@ a@@ ks and perf@@ ec@@ tion@@ ists should not get tat@@ to@@ os , and i &apos;m going to return to that point in a few minutes .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case though .
it re@@ minds me constantly of something else instead .
even in weal@@ thy countries it is common now to see ine@@ quality growing .
i wanted to focus on acti@@ vities that would help to all@@ ev@@ i@@ ate poverty , fight disease , combat climate change , bridge the religious , rac@@ ial and other divi@@ des that tor@@ ment the world , but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was per@@ formed so that it would swe@@ ep across the world more .
we just re@@ organized the markets .
you think about whatever your life has been , however many obstacles you have fac@@ ed in your life , at critical jun@@ c@@ tures you always knew there was a predic@@ table connection between the effort you exer@@ ted and the result you achiev@@ ed .
so she now works ful@@ l-@@ time on this for very little pay .
we &apos;re now working with partners in health and the minis@@ try of health in rwanda and our foundation folks to scale this system up .
i grew up in a very small village in canada , and i &apos;m an un@@ diagno@@ sed dy@@ sl@@ ex@@ ic . i had a really hard time in school .
and for me it &apos;s just the idea that , if this little girl gradu@@ ates as a whole person , chances are she &apos;ll demand a whole world -- a whole world -- to live on .
there isn &apos;t enough water .
no pe@@ tro@@ chemicals in the pav@@ ement .
and it &apos;s a kind of micro@@ cos@@ m of the glob@@ alized world .
but what &apos;s happening , our lear@@ n@@ ing@@ -@@ different kids -- dy@@ sl@@ ex@@ ic -- we &apos;ve ren@@ am@@ ed them pro@@ l@@ ex@@ ic -- are doing well in these beautiful , beautiful class@@ rooms .
the heart of school has seven kilometers of b@@ am@@ bo@@ o in it .
i used to be able to talk like that .
and before i left the hospital , after a year of being hospit@@ alized , i had seven rup@@ tures of my car@@ o@@ ti@@ d ar@@ ter@@ y .
i felt , and i still feel , a lot of distance from the human ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am .
it still needs impro@@ vement , but at least it sounds like me and not like h@@ al 9@@ 000 .
for almost all of its millions and billions of years , there was no life on earth at all .
does anybody remember that ? &quot;
iron@@ ic that my legs are fine , and it &apos;s my shoul@@ ders that slow up my walk .
i am writing as well as ever .
and i was very young then . i think i was 11 years , and i started asking questions , and that ’ s when my political education started .
because in the long run , i think there is no reason , no practical reason for newsp@@ ap@@ ers to survive .
in po@@ land , our pages were named &quot; co@@ vers of the year &quot; three times in a row .
then we ad@@ just the content accor@@ d@@ ingly .
so bear with me as i take you through this journey .
i was 6@@ 4 l@@ bs .
i was bal@@ d .
but the men had a better idea .
they re@@ moved a h@@ em@@ atom@@ a from behind my eye .
but a few years earlier , while still at school , he &apos;d actually cr@@ acked one of the big mathematical problems at the time .
he wrote , &quot; the universe cannot be read until we have lear@@ n@@ t the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written .
recently i took my family --
i can take all of these tiles , and fix them at the yellow place , rot@@ ate them by 90 degrees , put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there .
i can refl@@ ect it in the line through x , or the line through y , or the line through z .
it still ends up at half a turn .
here are two very different walls , very different ge@@ om@@ e@@ tric pictures .
and the power of gal@@ ois &apos; mathematical language is it also allows us to create symme@@ tri@@ cal objects in the un@@ seen world , beyond the two-@@ dimensional , three-@@ dimensional , all the way through to the four@@ - or fi@@ ve@@ - or infin@@ it@@ e-@@ dimensional space .
60 dig@@ its or more , you &apos;ve got to sit down . you &apos;ve over@@ estimat@@ ed .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and the transl@@ ations of the survi@@ ving tex@@ ts say , &quot; this i will not treat . this i cannot treat . &quot;
now there is something else , though , in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated .
they commis@@ sion@@ ed a group of their best scientists to investi@@ gate , and what they found was that all these tape dri@@ ves were loc@@ ated near venti@@ lation duc@@ ts . what happened was the bacter@@ icide was for@@ mul@@ ated with minute tr@@ aces of tin .
if we think , for example , of lou@@ is pa@@ st@@ eur , who in the 18@@ 60s was asked to study the diseases of silk wor@@ ms for the silk industry , and his disco@@ ver@@ ies were really the beginning of the ger@@ m theory of disease .
and so one kind of information space that i take inspiration from is my real des@@ k .
and i can pull them off when i want to work with them .
and similar to@@ po@@ graph@@ y .
so you &apos;ve effectively neg@@ ated 60 years of a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tic research .
and that &apos;s the thing , is that we &apos;re writing things , we &apos;re writing these things that we can no longer read .
but the difficul@@ ty of the problem and the fact that we don &apos;t really quite have it down , it doesn &apos;t take away from the effects pr@@ ag@@ matic chaos has . pr@@ ag@@ matic chaos , like all net@@ fli@@ x algorith@@ ms , deter@@ mines , in the end , 60 percent of what movies end up being r@@ ent@@ ed .
it &apos;s because the elev@@ ator is missing some important instru@@ mentation , like the but@@ tons .
unfortunately , we have our work cut out for us .
and war@@ ren bu@@ ff@@ et had re@@ comm@@ ended i do that -- being honest about what was going well , what wasn &apos;t , and making it kind of an annu@@ al thing .
actually evolved several things to avoid mal@@ ari@@ al dea@@ ths .
so the mo@@ squ@@ it@@ o@@ es that b@@ ite late at night can &apos;t get at them . and when you use in@@ door spr@@ aying with dd@@ t
i can say that , even though i &apos;m a college dro@@ p@@ -@@ out . i had great teachers .
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has inves@@ ted in this .
you might say , &quot; do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher &apos;s leave ? &quot; the answer is , on average , the slightly better teachers leave the system .
for example , new york passed a law that said that the teacher impro@@ vement data could not be made available and used in the ten@@ ure decision for the teachers .
you know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen .
they &apos;re expensive to inst@@ all , but they are more expensive not to . so , we should look at that .
so , there is a long history of stop sig@@ ns and y@@ i@@ eld sig@@ ns .
each one was pin@@ ched or car@@ ved out of a ball of clay , and it was the im@@ perf@@ ections that people cher@@ ished .
you can see the sort of break in the everyday .
he makes us the subject of his art .
i mean , there were after@@ no@@ ons i was down there , and the light goes pin@@ k and there &apos;s a mis@@ t in the air and you &apos;re standing in the ru@@ bble , and i found myself recogni@@ zing both the in@@ her@@ ent beauty of nature and the fact that nature , as time , is er@@ as@@ ing this w@@ ound .
in fact , medicine today is a team sport .
we heard over the last couple days what an ur@@ gent problem cancer still is in our society , what a pr@@ essing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute .
i mean , in many ways , the way that we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re still operating in the dark .
and the cool thing about flu@@ or@@ escence is that it &apos;s not only bright , it actually can sh@@ ine through tissue .
you see a lot of little , r@@ oun@@ dish bu@@ mps there .
what &apos;s the problem ?
i think that it &apos;ll change the way that we do surgery .
ed bo@@ y@@ den : a light switch for neurons
ide@@ ally , we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribu@@ te to certain fun@@ ctions and which ones go wrong in certain patho@@ logi@@ es .
well there are many molecules that exist in nature , which are able to con@@ vert light into electricity .
so this is very powerful .
now we &apos;ve shown that a bri@@ ef activ@@ ation of these is enough , indeed , to drive learning .
okay , there it goes . right now .
most of us don &apos;t have fun@@ g@@ i or al@@ ga@@ e in our brains , so what is our brain going to do if we put that in ?
so he &apos;s not using vision to do it .
and by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero .
and we looked at three different types of rooms .
and given the extraordinary amount of no@@ so@@ com@@ ial infec@@ tions , or hospit@@ al-@@ ac@@ qui@@ red infec@@ tions , this is a clu@@ e that it &apos;s a good time to re@@ consider our current practi@@ ces .
and so even though there were no cars still in the west village where we lived , my wife sent me out to buy a , you know , a large air fil@@ ter at the bed bat@@ h and beyond , which was loc@@ ated about 20 blocks away , north .
well , there are some kind of ex@@ ec@@ uti@@ ve decisions , but mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody .
because effectively , what &apos;s happening here , what &apos;s creating this page , obviously -- and we all know this , but it &apos;s worth just thinking about it -- is not some person dec@@ id@@ ing that i am the number one answer for steven johnson , but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and dec@@ id@@ ing to link to my page or not link to it , and google just sitting there and running the numbers .
google does the google ze@@ it@@ ge@@ ist , which looks at search re@@ ques@@ ts to test what &apos;s going on , what people are interested in , and they pu@@ b@@ lish it with lots of fun graph@@ s .
and right behind him is l@@ . ron hu@@ b@@ b@@ ard . so -- you can see we &apos;re in the as@@ co@@ t , which is always good .
now this is a very interesting thing .
&lt; transcript &gt;
but i don &apos;t know that that &apos;s the common debate .
and at what point did that uni@@ form turn from white to black ?
and the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farm@@ ing the same piece of ground for 40 cent@@ u@@ ries .
that &apos;s the name of the first chap@@ ter -- &quot; this book is not a tree . &quot;
so therefore , we have these two met@@ abolis@@ ms , and i worked with a ger@@ man chem@@ ist , michael br@@ au@@ n@@ gar@@ t , and we &apos;ve identi@@ fied the two fundamental met@@ abolis@@ ms .
and this is our project for ford motor company . it &apos;s the re@@ vit@@ alization of the river rouge in de@@ ar@@ born .
so the way we appro@@ ach@@ ed this is we studied the hydro@@ logy very carefully .
all@@ an j@@ ones : a map of the brain
and that &apos;s shown here in the the very light blue .
they &apos;re control@@ ling who nervous system cells partner up with .
so the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what &apos;s called an m@@ r .
this will then go onto a robot that &apos;s going to apply one of those st@@ ains to it .
and it contribu@@ tes to about 70 sam@@ ples of those thousand sam@@ ples .
proteins are t@@ arg@@ ets for drugs .
but the fact is our gen@@ omes are greater than 99 percent similar .
i &apos;ll just close by saying that the tools are there , and this is truly an un@@ explo@@ red , un@@ discovered continent .
and worst of all , we will never know .
and yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
i cannot answer the big question , whether aid did any good or not . but these three questions , i can answer them .
and maybe when you get there , what you find is this :
now , you might say , &quot; well , but it &apos;s not sustainable .
if they get it for free , they use it .
well , with experiments , what you can do is answer a simple question .
two billion dollars got ple@@ d@@ ged just last month ,
and yet , when the young global leader in dav@@ os showed the numbers i gave you , they started de@@ wor@@ m the world .
looking at fo@@ ss@@ ils d@@ ating back several millions of years -- it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here .
but i really for@@ mal@@ ized this focus on tur@@ nar@@ ounds when i was complet@@ ing my m@@ ba in the united states .
so africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers .
so let &apos;s start on that .
but not the south africa we always talk about -- the gold , the min@@ er@@ als , the first world infrastructure -- a bit about the other side of it .
looking at the oil industry , africa provi@@ des 18 percent of the u.s. &apos; s oil supply , with the middle east just 16 percent .
again , opportunity to t@@ ack@@ le markets to get that higher price .
let &apos;s look at some 2006 numbers . kenya : over 60 percent . nigeria : over 40 percent .
because things can be turned around rather quickly .
you@@ rs is the other way around , so s@@ wa@@ p it around .
k@@ t : no .
kb : where are we ? where are we ?
a lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened , all right .
can you stand over here ? this will just make it a little bit easier .
ex@@ tend your left arm , ok .
and as you sin@@ k and dri@@ ft and flo@@ at into this rela@@ x@@ ed state of mind , i &apos;m going to take your left hand , and just place it up here .
ok , it worked that time , excellent .
now , have a look at the co@@ ke bottle .
i also want you to think of his name . look at me and think of his name .
kb : ok , steve , i want you to take a seat , right behind here . excellent .
no , stay around , ok .
s@@ j : you &apos;re over a cu@@ p .
do you think the spi@@ ke is under your left hand , or under your right hand ?
it was all due to this woman , sister mary mar@@ ast@@ ela , also known as my mom .
in other words , i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in made people moral .
then we match them in pairs by computer .
but the second is that i still only had this indi@@ rec@@ t relationship between oxy@@ to@@ c@@ in and tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thin@@ ess .
a then unknown philosop@@ her named adam smith wrote a book in 17@@ 5@@ 9 called &quot; the theory of moral sentiments . &quot;
and a man says very excit@@ ed@@ ly , &quot; i was in your gas station a while ago , and i bought this je@@ wel@@ ry for my wife , and i can &apos;t find it . &quot; i said , &quot; pe@@ ar@@ l nec@@ k@@ la@@ ce ? &quot; &quot; yeah . &quot;
these are not people you want to have a be@@ er with .
and i dro@@ ve up in my r@@ ent@@ ed v@@ aux@@ hall .
i mean , ast@@ oun@@ ding ; no one has this .
eight hu@@ gs a day -- you &apos;ll be happ@@ ier and the world will be a better place .
the empire is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produ@@ ces these identi@@ cal people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?
at the same time , we also had lots of parents , rich people , who had computers , and who used to tell me , &quot; you know , my son , i think he &apos;s gi@@ f@@ ted , because he does wonderful things with computers .
there &apos;s one community of children in southern india whose english pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation is really bad , and they needed good pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation because that would improve their jobs .
so i asked this girl , &quot; can you help them ? &quot; so she says , &quot; absolutely not .
what an achiev@@ ement that is .
i &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called di@@ gg@@ les in nor@@ th@@ western england , deep inside a village in tam@@ il na@@ du , india , 6@@ ,000 miles away .
we &apos;ve brought it down to the t@@ ang@@ ent of an angle .
if you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then i &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the school of clou@@ ds , and create the future of learning .
sometimes i star@@ tle myself : i &apos;ll forget that i have it on , and i &apos;ll l@@ ean over to pick up something , and then it goes like -- -- &quot; oh ! &quot;
in this so@@ ar@@ ing demonstr@@ ation , dea@@ f per@@ cus@@ sion@@ ist ev@@ el@@ yn gl@@ en@@ nie illustr@@ ates how listening to music invol@@ ves much more than simply l@@ etting sound waves hit your ear@@ dru@@ ms .
and so on . my career would probably last about five years .
and so on . if i think of myself as a musici@@ an ...
no circum@@ st@@ ances at all were used to refu@@ se any en@@ try .
so it may be that , in certain h@@ all@@ s , this dynamic may well work .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i have the right to say it &apos;s a bad piece of music .
listen , listen , listen . now -- what can we do with th@@ under ?
and by saying something through music , which basically is sound , we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people .
sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night and i scre@@ am , &quot; 4@@ ch@@ an ! &quot;
rule one is you don &apos;t talk about / b / .
so we &apos;ve got this activis@@ t group that &apos;s this gr@@ ass@@ roots group that &apos;s come out of the site .
don &apos;t tell .
c@@ p : i stuck that th@@ read so it la@@ sted a few days .
as i said , i just went back to school , and i am consider@@ ing major@@ ing in urban studies
looking at dinosau@@ r evolution and studying it , di@@ gg@@ ing it up for many years , i end up looking at the mam@@ mal radiation , and it seems as though everything is quick time , just like technology , adv@@ ancing by an order of mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de .
at the bottom of the c@@ lif@@ f , we find that they &apos;re rare as h@@ ens &apos; teeth .
well , they &apos;re compos@@ ed of people who understand science as adv@@ enture with a purpose .
it &apos;s only been with us for less than a century , and in that time , that fourth dimension , when radio@@ active d@@ ating came about , less than a century ago , and we could actually tell how old some of these things were , is probably the most profound transformation , because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dra@@ ma@@ tically .
narr@@ ator : ... as long as their boat .
we pro@@ ved with those measu@@ rements that cro@@ co@@ di@@ les scal@@ ed is@@ om@@ e@@ tric@@ ally .
and so , in addition to di@@ gg@@ ing , i think we have some answers from the dinosau@@ r record . i think these dinosaurs migr@@ ated -- we call it dis@@ pers@@ al -- around the globe , with the sli@@ gh@@ test land bridge .
i became an artist . o@@ .@@ k. , and started drawing .
but when we look back at our own country , we &apos;re looking back at our cities , the cities where most of you come from -- certainly the city i come from -- there &apos;s le@@ gi@@ ons of kids out there like these .
and as a little girl , i loved the idea of a robot that inter@@ acted with us much more like a hel@@ p@@ ful , tru@@ sted si@@ de@@ k@@ ick -- something that would deli@@ ght us , en@@ rich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .
mat@@ t ber@@ lin : hel@@ lo , le@@ o .
but with the robot , you can .
so it seems like this physical , social em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment actually really makes a difference .
and then it could help track that for you .
my sons , they love the screen . they love the screen .
i think that &apos;s very , very important .
but the under@@ -@@ under@@ dog hang@@ s tough ,
the may@@ ans and az@@ t@@ ec@@ s engag@@ ed , which is why there are very few may@@ ans and az@@ t@@ ec@@ s .
they have f@@ ang@@ s , they have cl@@ a@@ ws , they have n@@ im@@ bl@@ eness , they have speed .
a couple years ago , em@@ ily ba@@ er sig@@ ned up for a race called the har@@ dro@@ ck 100 , which tells you all you need to know about the race .
so what if we evolved as hun@@ ting pack animals ?
it &apos;s a really comp@@ elling argument that maybe the tar@@ a@@ hu@@ mar@@ a are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years ,
stop foc@@ using on urban mar@@ ath@@ ons , which , if you do four hours , you su@@ ck .
and it &apos;s about our fix@@ ation with celebr@@ ity and celebr@@ ity culture , and the importance of the image :
and this was a sequence of images .
very few of us know the real people --
and trying to ti@@ ti@@ ll@@ ate by sho@@ oting through do@@ or@@ ways and shu@@ t@@ ters and so on and so forth , and only showing certain angles to create a reality that , obviously , is completely construc@@ ted .
should i do advertis@@ ing ? -- at the time .
and i think it doesn &apos;t really matter that my work is considered hu@@ mor@@ ous , in a way ; i think it &apos;s a way in for me to deal with the importance of imag@@ ery and how we read all our information through imag@@ ery .
chris anderson : thank you .
by the time you get to 50 , it &apos;s almost no one left in nigeria --
you can &apos;t de@@ pend on foreign aid alone .
let me lead you through a day in the life of the heart institute ,
we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology .
80 percent of u.s. practi@@ ces do not have them , and yet the technology is there .
indi@@ rec@@ tly , we have saved the government of jam@@ ai@@ ca five million dollars from people that would have gone to mi@@ ami or at@@ l@@ anta for care .
who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care ?
and i want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking .
so , what is thinking in pictures ? it &apos;s literally movies in your head .
that was like just so super cool .
and there in the background is the pattern for fol@@ ding it .
you have another horse , where maybe the hor@@ s@@ es@@ ho@@ er beat him up
now , here is a horse that was dea@@ th@@ ly afraid of black co@@ w@@ boy h@@ ats .
and he studied al@@ z@@ heimer &apos;s patients that had frontal tempor@@ al lo@@ be dem@@ enti@@ a .
my mother said , &quot; well let &apos;s do a picture of something else . &quot;
but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
t@@ g : well , first of all , you &apos;ve got to look at age .
and server far@@ ms , or data centers are great libr@@ aries of knowledge .
okay .
now on the surface , this makes a lot of sense , and in 2010 , we respon@@ ded to the tsunami in chi@@ le , the f@@ loo@@ ds in pakistan , we sent training te@@ ams to the th@@ ai@@ -@@ bur@@ ma bor@@ der .
going back , that same 18@@ -year-old boy gradu@@ ates from high school in k@@ ans@@ as city , miss@@ our@@ i , jo@@ ins the army , the army gives him a ri@@ f@@ le , they send him to iraq .
let &apos;s start here .
even the print@@ ing press , even the print@@ ing press was as@@ sum@@ ed to be a tool that was going to en@@ force ca@@ tho@@ lic intellectual he@@ g@@ em@@ on@@ y across europe .
better argu@@ ing ? that &apos;s the question .
when you adop@@ t a tool , you also adop@@ t the management philosophy em@@ be@@ dded in that tool , and he wasn &apos;t going to adop@@ t anything that didn &apos;t work the way the lin@@ u@@ x community worked .
it &apos;s an open-source program@@ ming language , and all of the inter@@ connections between the people -- this is now not a software graph , but a people graph , all of the inter@@ connections among the people working on that project — and this doesn &apos;t look like an or@@ g char@@ t .
the stuff in red is the stuff that got del@@ et@@ ed .
a new form of argu@@ ing has been invented in our life@@ times , in the last decade , in fact .
wher@@ ever anybody else looks , look somewhere else , and go do something different , you know , and doing that .
but i said i &apos;m going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have .
why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved ?
this is one very large cr@@ ater . ge@@ o@@ logists love cr@@ at@@ ers , because cr@@ at@@ ers are like di@@ gg@@ ing a big hole in the ground without really working at it , and you can see what &apos;s below the surface .
you know , one of them , one of the whe@@ els is stuck , is not working ,
and as you can see , this is a picture of the spac@@ ec@@ r@@ aft put on mars , but i thought that just in case you &apos;re going to miss that show , you know , in 17 days , i &apos;ll show you , kind of , a little bit of what &apos;s going to happen .
the fabri@@ c and the sti@@ t@@ ching could just pull apart .
so it will be a very ten@@ se moment , you know , as we are watching that spac@@ ec@@ r@@ aft l@@ anding on another planet .
and then we back off , you know , from that point .
but for scientists , also the r@@ ings have a special meaning , because we believe they represent , on a small scale , how the solar system actually formed .
so this is a yel@@ low@@ stone , you know , of satur@@ n .
so here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our earth , but is all made of eth@@ ane and meth@@ ane and organic material .
what i &apos;d like to talk about today is understanding these exponenti@@ al technologies .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
and of course , there &apos;s an ap@@ p for that .
you can step on the scale .
how about augment@@ ing the physici@@ an ?
you can s@@ wal@@ low this completely integr@@ ated device .
we &apos;re now appro@@ ach@@ ing essentially a thou@@ sand@@ -@@ dollar genome --
we can be prev@@ ent@@ ative ; that pre@@ vention can be person@@ alized ; and more importantly , it &apos;s going to become increasingly partici@@ pat@@ ory .
we &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of top@@ ics , particularly in cardi@@ o@@ vas@@ cu@@ lar disease .
a@@ ar@@ on o &apos;@@ conn@@ ell : making sense of a visible quantum object
and so this is a great conceptu@@ al model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a parti@@ cle physi@@ cist .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chi@@ p .
the rest of the time they &apos;re del@@ oc@@ alized .
i was sort of aston@@ ished to find out how many i have actually .
it actually happened right at the time we met .
not ex@@ cre@@ ment mer@@ ely , not mer@@ ely surface and ori@@ fice going un@@ wash@@ ed , re@@ diff@@ usion of ru@@ m , there was will in it , and intention , power and purpose -- a social , eth@@ ical rage and re@@ bel@@ li@@ on --
60 nearly , yet these har@@ dly tan@@ gi@@ ble , har@@ dly better than har@@ lots , can still sti@@ r me .
but i think we &apos;re looking for something more .
so when we are confron@@ ted by a powerful image , we all have a choice :
this is me . my name is ben sau@@ n@@ ders .
i &apos;d read lots of books . i studied maps and char@@ ts .
the first one was reach@@ ing the pole itself .
at first it was pretty sensible . we fle@@ w british air@@ ways to mos@@ cow .
i was ski@@ ing into head@@ win@@ ds for nine out of the 10 weeks i was alone last year , and i was dri@@ f@@ ting back@@ wards most of the time .
the wi@@ reless telescope was a digital camera i had tu@@ cked in my po@@ cket .
i di@@ al@@ ed my gir@@ l@@ friend . i di@@ al@@ ed the ce@@ o of my spon@@ s@@ or .
i was ba@@ w@@ ling my eyes out by the time the plane land@@ ed -- a pretty emotional moment .
why ? i &apos;m not an explorer in the traditional sense .
every south pole ex@@ pe@@ dition you may have heard about is either flo@@ wn out from the pole or has used vehic@@ les or dogs or k@@ ites to do some kind of cross@@ ing -- no one has ever made a return journey . so that &apos;s the plan .
&quot; oh , don &apos;t worry about it , &quot; he said .
so i looked carefully at this guy .
and i think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflic@@ ts of interest work on us , and try not to trust our own intuition to over@@ come it , but to try to do things that prevent us from falling pre@@ y to these behavi@@ ors , because we can create lots of un@@ des@@ ir@@ able circum@@ st@@ ances .
so maybe that &apos;s why we think of fear , sometimes , as a danger in and of itself .
now the last option was the long@@ est , and the most difficult : to s@@ ail 1,@@ 500 miles due south in hop@@ es of reach@@ ing a certain band of win@@ ds that could eventually push them toward the coast of south america .
in fear , just like in fiction , one thing always leads to another .
why were they sw@@ ayed by one story so much more than the other ?
well , one or two br@@ ave sou@@ ls .
but i &apos;m a scientist and i don &apos;t like to make data out of an@@ ec@@ d@@ otes , so let &apos;s look at some data .
so , suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share need@@ les .
are we any more rational about sex ?
and , again , it &apos;s because of an align@@ ment of the incenti@@ ves .
and the other thing is that people are simply not as scar@@ ed of hiv as they were of aids , and ri@@ ghtly so .
this is what factory workers ear@@ n in an hour in in@@ don@@ es@@ ia : on average , 20 cents .
as a democratic revolution led by tech@@ -@@ em@@ powered young people s@@ wee@@ ps the ar@@ ab world , w@@ ad@@ ah k@@ han@@ far , the head of al jaz@@ e@@ era , shares a prof@@ oun@@ dly optimis@@ tic view of what &apos;s happening in eg@@ y@@ pt , tun@@ is@@ ia , lib@@ ya and beyond -- at this powerful moment when people realized they could step out of their houses and ask for change .
now i am here to tell you that the future that we were dre@@ aming for has eventually arrived .
yes , some of these young people are connected to the internet , but the connec@@ tivity in the ar@@ ab world is very little , is very small , because of many problems that we are suffering from .
al jaz@@ e@@ era is not a tool of revolution .
how would you character@@ ize the histor@@ ical signific@@ ance of what &apos;s happened ?
they &apos;ve had some spea@@ kers there .
down below , there was her grand@@ son plo@@ wing the to@@ b@@ acc@@ o field with a mu@@ le .
it &apos;s called cl@@ aw@@ -@@ ham@@ mer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
it was hard on the c@@ ats , but it made a great little instrument .
my brother and i ste@@ pped out of the car .
now , my brother and i had never heard anything like that in our whole lives . it was so beautiful .
there &apos;s a star@@ ry cro@@ wn in heav@@ en , i know .
break it off , put it on your finger , and slide into the notes .
sometimes i think it &apos;s better just to sin@@ k way down in your fun@@ ky mo@@ od &apos; til you can rise up hum@@ ming these steel gu@@ it@@ ar blu@@ es .
we weren &apos;t stupid : we put up a she@@ et of pl@@ y@@ wood about five feet in front of it .
when dr@@ um machines were new , i got to thinking , why couldn &apos;t you take the ol@@ dest form of music , the ham@@ bone rhy@@ th@@ ms , and combine it with the ne@@ west technology ?
on the other hand , somehow we manage to reason together as a community , from in@@ complete evidence to conclu@@ sions that we all agree about .
their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand , and a society on the other hand , were clo@@ sely related .
they ’ re thinking about the same things .
21@@ st-@@ century science is going to be driven by the integr@@ ation of these two ideas : the tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h of rel@@ ational ways of thinking about the world , on the one hand , and self-@@ organization or dar@@ win@@ ian ways of thinking about the world , on the other hand .
and i get , over time , bo@@ red by them .
it &apos;s a wonderful , very cr@@ af@@ t-@@ orient@@ ed society .
and at the same time , i &apos;m extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people &apos;s happ@@ in@@ esses .
when i had the idea of doing one , the process was i made the decision and i put it into my daily plann@@ er book .
and mostly also because i realized out of a re@@ m ko@@ ol@@ ha@@ as presentation to the city of por@@ to , where he talked about a con@@ gl@@ om@@ er@@ ation of various lay@@ ers of meaning .
second insi@@ ght . so far , until that point i had been mostly involved or used the language of design for prom@@ o@@ tional pur@@ pos@@ es ,
while we built all this up during that week , with the 100 volunte@@ ers , a good number of the neighbors surr@@ oun@@ ding the pla@@ z@@ a got very close to it and quite loved it .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m alive . i &apos;m happy i &apos;m alive .
water &apos;s pu@@ mped from the lake and is fil@@ tered and shot as a fine mis@@ t through an arr@@ ay of high-@@ pressure fo@@ g no@@ zz@@ les , 3@@ 5,000 of them . and a weather station is on the structure .
and this is the highest honor to be bes@@ to@@ wed upon an architect in swit@@ zer@@ land -- to have a chocol@@ ate bar .
in any case , the way it works is that an intelligent navig@@ ator basically maps the entire surface of these walls .
this elev@@ ator &apos;s about the size of a new york city studio a@@ partment .
and we asked ourselves , why couldn &apos;t it be exhi@@ bi@@ tion@@ istic , like the met , or like some of the other buildings at lin@@ col@@ n center ?
but it &apos;s acou@@ sti@@ cally engine@@ ered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage . and here &apos;s an acou@@ stic shel@@ f .
we &apos;re going to kind of go in a different direction right now .
everybody li@@ kes to have their own animal that they named .
they put them in fo@@ am , little con@@ tain@@ ers . they &apos;re very well taken care of .
you can only deter@@ mine rel@@ at@@ ed@@ ness by looking for simil@@ ari@@ ties .
the dom@@ e , that little dom@@ e , is growing really fast .
and that &apos;s pretty cool .
the bone histo@@ logy tells us that ed@@ mon@@ to@@ sau@@ rus is a ju@@ ven@@ ile , or at least a sub-@@ adult , and the other one is an adult and we have an on@@ to@@ gen@@ y .
&lt; transcript &gt;
thank you . br@@ un@@ o &apos;s face , just then , he said , &quot; no , don &apos;t go through this . don &apos;t , please don &apos;t .
and there he is .
that re@@ minds me , i must post that letter . &quot;
&quot; and now it &apos;s got a han@@ go@@ ver . &quot;
i think it would be something out of the aqu@@ atic ape thing , wouldn &apos;t it ?
and we all want to believe in president obama .
&quot; tell a lie ; it was di@@ ana ross ... &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
it is also important for the environment , because the world &apos;s energy requi@@ rements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade .
and when i went out to meet the press , they zer@@ o@@ ed in , said , &quot; why are you wearing that s@@ na@@ ke p@@ in ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; well i &apos;ve been a woman for 60 years , but i &apos;ve only been secre@@ t@@ ary of state for a few minutes . &quot;
i think that they thought that it was a soft issue .
if you think that , you &apos;ve for@@ gotten high school .
i think we also need to be sup@@ por@@ tive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other .
if your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you fli@@ p a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
there are other questions like this , too .
but to do it , you need a long , single str@@ and of dna , which is techn@@ ically very difficult to get .
so , they &apos;re all flo@@ ating around in solution , and to look at them , you have to get them on a surface where they stick .
now , this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer , so we have a long way to go .
and in order to get these kinds of compu@@ tations started right , you need some kind of input , a kind of seed .
and so we can exponenti@@ ally reduce the number of dna str@@ ands we use , if we use coun@@ ting , if we use a little bit of compu@@ tation .
what it &apos;s really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light , asking new ver@@ sions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things . thank you .
for those from the developing world , there is nothing , absolutely nothing new in this idea .
often it is the con@@ str@@ aining or the back@@ -@@ to-@@ the-@@ wall situation that the ha@@ pl@@ ess common man fin@@ ds himself or her@@ self in that leads him to pay a bri@@ be .
i propose to explore this idea further , to exam@@ ine the potential of creating a for@@ -@@ profit , fe@@ e-@@ based b@@ p@@ o kind of service to stop bri@@ bes and prevent corruption .
so you take the next step , or use the next tool available in what we are putting together , and then he rel@@ ents .
let me begin with an example .
to serve other people , not to manipul@@ ate other people .
the emer@@ gency room as@@ certain@@ ed that the kid had no al@@ co@@ ho@@ l in his blood . and they were ready to let the kid go .
moral skill is chi@@ pped away by an over@@ -@@ reli@@ ance on rules that de@@ pri@@ ves us of the opportunity to improvis@@ e and learn from our improvis@@ ations .
right ?
but exc@@ essive reli@@ ance on incenti@@ ves dem@@ or@@ aliz@@ es professional activity in two sen@@ ses of that word .
why ? because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go .
if you run an organization , you should be sure that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs -- have job descri@@ p@@ tions like the job descri@@ p@@ tions of the jan@@ it@@ ors .
i think people want to be allowed to be virtu@@ ous .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
so , i decided we &apos;ve got to do this .
he &apos;s pun@@ ching our contr@@ ols guy . the guy behind him is our engineer / surgeon , which is a conven@@ ient guy to have around .
&quot; well , would it help if i ... &quot;
he &apos;s got no legs . he &apos;s got no arms .
i &apos;ll sh@@ ut up , except one message
i &apos;ve never seen a bird flying around at m@@ ach 2 .
narr@@ ator : and so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
so this is a call , a ple@@ a , to the incredibly tal@@ ent@@ ed ted community .
i would later find out that was hou@@ din@@ i &apos;s personal record . in 198@@ 7 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was tr@@ apped under a river .
so , i got my hands on that chemical , filled the sin@@ k up with it , and stuck my face in the sin@@ k and tried to breathe that in , which was really impossible .
and you &apos;re really ri@@ d@@ ding your body of co2 .
and by eating so well and training so hard , my res@@ ting hear@@ t-@@ rate dro@@ pped to 3@@ 8 be@@ ats per minute .
i realized that my real competition was the be@@ av@@ er .
and i did a di@@ ve down to 1@@ 60 feet , which is basically the he@@ ight of a 16 story building , and as i was coming up , i bl@@ acked out under@@ water , which is really dangerous ; that &apos;s how you dro@@ wn .
and i knew that that was blood sh@@ un@@ ting , when the blood rus@@ h@@ es away from your extre@@ mi@@ ties to provide oxygen to your v@@ ital organs .
as though that wasn &apos;t enough , what i did immediately after is i went to qu@@ est lab@@ s and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were , so the doctors could use it , once again .
mat@@ t m@@ ills : now , what &apos;s great about this is , there &apos;s no tric@@ k@@ ery here .
okay . so , as we &apos;re talking about cambridge , let &apos;s now move on to technical adv@@ anc@@ ements , because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago , the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomen@@ al rate , and that means that i can now take cin@@ em@@ a-@@ quality 3d models and place them in the world around me , so i have one over here .
mm : fel@@ lows are really good at that .
: man : ... extremely dangerous questions .
that &apos;s why they migr@@ ate to cities .
for us , where does it take us , as social activis@@ ts and entrepreneurs ?
do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of west ni@@ le f@@ ever ?
today , there &apos;s another kind of movement . it &apos;s a movement to save the earth .
in the summer of love , in 196@@ 7 , two million people , children , died of small@@ po@@ x .
the first wave of evolution is what we think of as dar@@ win@@ ian evolution .
this is the largest cat in the world -- the li@@ on-@@ ti@@ ger hybri@@ d .
other states have b@@ ann@@ ed them .
a som@@ atic cell , a body cell , was taken from its body , g@@ est@@ ated in the ov@@ um of a cow , and then that cow gave birth to a gu@@ ar .
so that when the mot@@ h actually emerg@@ es as a mot@@ h , it is already pre@@ wired .
they self-@@ ag@@ gre@@ g@@ ated into a network , became an integr@@ ated chi@@ p .
for the first time in the history of this planet , we are able to directly design organisms .
he was raised by very sup@@ por@@ tive and interested parents .
and for many decades now there have been a series of tom@@ s satellites that have coll@@ ected data about the radiation of the earth &apos;s surface .
and has been re@@ cru@@ ited over and over again by evolution , as often happens .
a remarkable , remarkable tes@@ tam@@ ent to the power of evolution .
we live in a world where we have ligh@@ tly and dar@@ kly pig@@ ment@@ ed people living next to one another ,
spread the word .
some of them are artificial .
they were done on a computer ,
now look at that . that &apos;s a real lun@@ g .
and at the end , you get things like that .
so it was in 18@@ 75 to 19@@ 25 , an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world .
and amazing .
and it went really well 50 years ago .
and like the thousands of people that had tried before , i found nothing .
it &apos;s so complicated .
now , you could ask this question , why were the doctors doing this ?
now comes the bet@@ we@@ en-@@ subj@@ ects design , the ab design , the ab testing .
anyone ? it &apos;s much more difficult .
remember , the dec@@ k was stac@@ ked against you .
and that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that , we could focus on her re@@ co@@ very .
only seven percent of ar@@ able land in africa is ir@@ ri@@ g@@ ated , compared to 40 percent in asia .
like its agriculture , africa &apos;s markets are highly under@@ -@@ capit@@ alized and in@@ efficient .
and we calcul@@ ated that some 3@@ 00,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to ro@@ t in early 2002 .
well , the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous lo@@ sses led to the birth of the fu@@ tures market , and the under@@ lying system of grad@@ ing grain and rece@@ i@@ p@@ ting -- issu@@ ing war@@ e@@ house rece@@ i@@ p@@ ts on the basis of which trade could be done .
because we don &apos;t think the country &apos;s ready for full electron@@ ic tr@@ ading .
ec@@ x , mo@@ re@@ over , can become a tr@@ ading platform for a pan@@ -@@ african market in agri@@ cultural com@@ modi@@ ties .
that &apos;s a cy@@ cli@@ cal process .
the d@@ unes here move sou@@ th@@ ward at a pace of around 600 meters a year .
all we need to do is soli@@ di@@ fy the parts that we need to be solid , and then exc@@ av@@ ate the sand , and we have our architecture .
we then pull the pi@@ les up through the d@@ une and we &apos;re able to create almost any conce@@ iv@@ able shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mo@@ ld as we go up .
now , there are many details left to explore in this s@@ chem@@ e -- political , practical , eth@@ ical , financial .
so i did just that .
hu@@ mor@@ ist john ho@@ d@@ g@@ man ram@@ bles through a new story about ali@@ ens , physics , time , space and the way all of these somehow contribu@@ te to a sweet , perfect memory of falling in love .
isn &apos;t it a little conven@@ ient that in the mid@@ st of the world war , out of no@@ where , suddenly an itali@@ an scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and dar@@ ken the history of the human species forever after ?
and then they stopped , and the man turned to me and said , &quot; what are you looking for , flying sau@@ c@@ ers ? &quot;
i went with my friend tim mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al , who sat on my left .
he could never leave the t@@ ank or interact with the outside world .
something od@@ d ? something off ? something wrong with this picture ?
she was sm@@ iling .
the stars align@@ ed , and she came back .
and the view of scientists about how coral re@@ efs work , how they ought to be , was based on these re@@ efs without any fish .
and the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe , like a hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e , some kind of succ@@ essi@@ onal sequence of re@@ co@@ very , but what &apos;s going on now is that over@@ fishing and pollution and climate change are all inter@@ acting in a way that prev@@ ents that .
and that &apos;s everywhere .
it &apos;s very pretty , and it has rapidly started to over@@ grow the once very rich bio@@ diversity of the nor@@ th@@ western me@@ dit@@ er@@ ran@@ ean .
that &apos;s the same species .
and , of course , arc@@ tic communities are to@@ ast .
and dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they &apos;ll start to mer@@ ge ,
and hope actually is at the heart of this .
maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pul@@ ls carbon out of the atmosphere , which is what we &apos;re going to need to be doing by the end of the century .
adam smith , 200 years ago , spoke about our desire for a life without shame .
ke@@ y@@ nes called this the &quot; parado@@ x of th@@ ri@@ ft &quot; -- saving s@@ lows down re@@ co@@ very .
or might we actually occa@@ sion@@ ally be something like the sel@@ fl@@ ess al@@ tru@@ ist de@@ pic@@ ted in rem@@ br@@ and@@ t &apos;s lo@@ vely , lo@@ vely sk@@ et@@ ch here ?
we can just put in a little search term .
so let me come back , with this sense of hope , to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a s@@ kin@@ ny lat@@ te from the ca@@ fe next door .
you &apos;re making news out of the things that tell you that we &apos;re fl@@ our@@ ishing .
and we don &apos;t really understand what oil is , until you check out its molecules ,
it tri@@ ples the amount of o@@ ily , mess@@ y go@@ o that you have in the water , and it makes it very hard to hand@@ le .
it is green . it is a sh@@ r@@ ine to green@@ ish@@ ness .
and it also the kind of ro@@ ot of how we see oil as a con@@ spir@@ acy .
everything that we are really st@@ em@@ med from this period .
they have degrees in political science , degrees in business --
so the people of the gulf have essentially been sub@@ si@@ di@@ zing the rest of us through a less@@ -@@ clean environment .
we need to have more mo@@ bility choices .
we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get dis@@ trac@@ ted by the theater , not get dis@@ trac@@ ted by the cognitive dis@@ son@@ ance of the green possibilities that are out there .
people watch it all over the country also in public places .
they don &apos;t sing pop son@@ gs , they sing af@@ gh@@ an music .
and the most immedi@@ ate thought when i came out of that water was the following : i &apos;m never , ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again .
when you &apos;re trying to do that , and then the bodies are coming past you , it hum@@ bles you , and you also realize very , very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are .
every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming , you must forget .
because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
this is called the reg@@ is@@ try of standard biological parts .
on the right , that &apos;s a radi@@ ol@@ ar@@ a .
so we &apos;ve trac@@ ked in the video the input string , which was green , green , yellow , yellow , green .
so can you make a machine that could make any pres@@ cri@@ ption l@@ ens very quickly on site ?
i &apos;m going to se@@ gue a little here .
this is a k@@ ite designed by a guy called d@@ ave k@@ ul@@ p .
so if we &apos;re seriously talking about t@@ ack@@ ling climate change on an urban@@ izing planet , we need to look somewhere else for the solution .
and this is a huge , huge energy sav@@ ings ,
and while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capac@@ i@@ ties -- such as cooking or making ice sculp@@ tures or even a ma@@ fi@@ a hit -- what we probably will find is that , in fact , turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them , is a far smar@@ ter way to go .
i would sub@@ mit to you that all of these things are not only possible , they &apos;re being done right now , and that it &apos;s a dar@@ n good thing .
for example , any social history will re@@ v@@ eal that mu@@ ti@@ lation and tor@@ ture were rou@@ tine forms of crimin@@ al pun@@ ish@@ ment . the kind of infr@@ action today that would give you a fine , in those days would result in your ton@@ gue being cut out , your ears being cut off , you being bl@@ ind@@ ed , a hand being ch@@ op@@ ped off and so on .
&quot; i don &apos;t really want to kill that guy , but he &apos;s about to kill me .
.
and really this is about the be@@ dro@@ om .
but if i would change this axis here , i would instead put income per person .
because in fact , this is child labor . my son and his wife sat in a clo@@ set for many years and developed this .
which have great entrepreneurs , but also have the collap@@ sing countries .
they have been saving , you know , over the last decade .
and then it &apos;s united states today , up here .
we have a continu@@ um . but we still have , of course , congo , up there . we still have as poor countries as we have had , always , in history .
braz@@ il here has amazing social impro@@ vement over the last 16 years ,
the size of the bu@@ b@@ bles is how many are hiv affected .
make it a local issue . and do pre@@ vention at each place , in the way it can be done there .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and it will not happen around one super@@ power .
dam@@ ien runs a hotel outside of kin@@ sh@@ as@@ a .
but if what we &apos;re really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv , we need to think about the custom@@ er , the people whose behavior needs to change -- the cou@@ ples , the young women , the young men -- whose lives de@@ pend on it .
and amaz@@ ingly , that evolution sust@@ ains the traj@@ ect@@ ory that biological evolution had estab@@ li@@ shed toward greater complexity .
you have them in hun@@ ter@@ -@@ gather@@ er societies , but then through technological evolution , new forms of technology ar@@ ise that facilit@@ ate or encourage the playing of non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum games , invol@@ ving more people over larger territ@@ ory .
it is non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum . and by that i mean , if people in the musli@@ m world get more hat@@ eful , more res@@ ent@@ ful , less happy with their place in the world , it &apos;ll be bad for the west . if they get more happy , it &apos;ll be good for the west .
there &apos;s going to have to be a less@@ ening of the amount of hat@@ red in the world , given how dangerous it &apos;s becoming .
you don &apos;t want to say , &quot; well , yeah , i can kind of understand how a human being in those circum@@ st@@ ances would hate the country i live in . &quot; that &apos;s not a ple@@ as@@ ant thing , but i think it &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to have to get used to and work on . now , i want to stress that to understand , you know -- there are people who don &apos;t like this whole business of understanding the gr@@ ass@@ roots , the ro@@ ot causes of things ; they don &apos;t want to know why people hate us . i want to understand it .
i have list@@ ened to the three previous spea@@ kers , and guess what happened ?
the wrong fram@@ ing is a product of thinking that africa is a place of des@@ pair .
they are thro@@ wing large su@@ ms of money for primary health , for primary education , for food reli@@ ef .
aid is the bad instrument , and do you know why ?
but i want to put a c@@ ave@@ at on my argument , and that c@@ ave@@ at is that it is not true that aid is always des@@ truc@@ tive .
trade and industry takes 4@@ 3 billion .
so i said , &quot; well , how many words do i get ? &quot;
that we could create a classi@@ fication of the mental ill@@ n@@ esses .
you can ask , how do you st@@ ack up for positive emotion , for meaning , for flow , against literally tens of thousands of other people ?
that &apos;s what arist@@ ot@@ le was talking about .
len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affec@@ ti@@ vities .
so , that &apos;s the second path . the first path , positive emotion .
when you do something philanthro@@ pic to help another person , it la@@ sts and it la@@ sts .
and so , the par@@ alle@@ l thing holds with technology , entertainment and design , i believe . that is , it is possible for these three dri@@ vers of our world to increase happiness , to increase positive emotion , and that &apos;s typically how they &apos;ve been used .
shot straight down , so these are the sh@@ ado@@ ws of the cam@@ els .
and he said , &quot; oh , yeah , i remember that too !
and a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le wal@@ ks up a ri@@ ver@@ bank toward its den .
we were looking at the same issue that richard w@@ ur@@ man tou@@ ches upon in his new world population project .
photograph@@ y can also com@@ pe@@ l us to con@@ front issues that are potenti@@ ally dis@@ tr@@ essing and contro@@ ver@@ si@@ al .
she &apos;s probably -- it &apos;s a shame you can &apos;t see it in the photograph , but she &apos;s 12 feet long .
&lt; transcript &gt;
when i finished , i went to the itu@@ ri forest for my intern@@ ship .
on their way , they lo@@ ot@@ ed everything .
that is people moving around , that &apos;s even py@@ g@@ mi@@ es .
with friends , we had been sitting and watching match football , and having some good music with world@@ space radio , when it started , i think .
they used me to carry that , and i was doing coun@@ ting , what comes from where , and where , and where .
and during the war , after a week of heavy war , fighting in the area , we succe@@ e@@ ded : we had the first ok@@ ap@@ i .
i think we see the war like a game -- like so@@ c@@ cer , football .
they can &apos;t even att@@ ain the ba@@ ch@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree .
if you take the difference between these two images here , you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the sh@@ ine off of em@@ ily &apos;s skin .
and you can see those different wr@@ in@@ k@@ les actually show up as she anim@@ ates .
and i say believe because this process is still on@@ going .
so descend into hu@@ aut@@ la plat@@ eau in mexico .
it was developed within a two-@@ year period and used on actual explor@@ atory projects .
there are two primary t@@ arg@@ ets we &apos;re doing here .
there are three under@@ pin@@ n@@ ings of working in space priv@@ ately .
the way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube st@@ ack that has to be launched from the ground , and res@@ ist all kinds of a@@ ero@@ dynamic forces .
in seven years , we could pull off an industrial mission to sh@@ ack@@ let@@ on and demonstr@@ ate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-@@ earth or@@ bit .
ok .
i have some ones that were long la@@ sting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occu@@ pation , and it led to a sense of failure .
so , when i look at creativity , i also think that it is this sense or this in@@ ability to re@@ press , my looking at associ@@ ations in pr@@ ac@@ tically anything in life .
a very famous chinese saying , she said .
and when i have the question , it is a focus .
sometimes i get help from the universe , it seems .
and it was a man , a chinese man , and he was stac@@ king these things , not with glu@@ e , not with anything .
and so i was there on three occa@@ sions , different seas@@ ons .
i have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that .
tv and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way .
imagine what the world was like 40 years ago when it was just the satur@@ day ev@@ ening post and time and new@@ s@@ week .
and that is the essence of where idea diff@@ usion is going .
now he &apos;s in london , and he ships by fe@@ de@@ x all around the world .
this y@@ oy@@ o right here cost 1@@ 12 dollars , but it sle@@ e@@ ps for 12 minutes .
and one person at a time , the idea sp@@ re@@ ads .
they didn &apos;t tri@@ ple their sales with advertis@@ ing ; they tri@@ pl@@ ed it by doing something remarkable .
i would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photograp@@ her for national geographic magazine .
this problem has continu@@ ed to grow each year since i was there .
i also , with the story , wanted to show read@@ ers how fish are caught , some of the me@@ tho@@ ds that are used to catch fish , like a bottom tra@@ w@@ ler , which is one of the most common me@@ tho@@ ds in the world .
this is a low-@@ altitude photograph that i made showing our di@@ ve boat with about a do@@ zen of these big old ti@@ ger sharks sort of just swimming around behind .
after i left bi@@ min@@ i , i actually learned that this habitat was being bul@@ l@@ do@@ zed to create a new golf course and res@@ ort .
this photo shows an animal po@@ pping its head out at sun@@ set off the coast of flor@@ id@@ a .
and i really wanted this story to be about three things :
&lt; / transcript &gt;
now i &apos;m not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the black death .
there was a very sick or@@ angu@@ tan baby , my first encoun@@ ter .
people spent so much of their money on health issues and dr@@ inking water .
what we did was we for@@ mul@@ ated reci@@ pes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation .
may .
and if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divi@@ ded into stri@@ ps that go over different types of soil , and we were actually monit@@ or@@ ing , measur@@ ing every single tree in these 2,000 h@@ ect@@ ares , 5,000 ac@@ res .
and then slowly , the trees start taking over , bringing in produce from the fruits , from the tim@@ ber , from the fuel wood .
in the trop@@ ics , rain@@ dro@@ ps are not formed from ice cr@@ y@@ st@@ als , which is the case in the temper@@ ate zones , you need the trees with &#91; un@@ clear &#93; , chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initi@@ ate the rain@@ dro@@ ps .
they have enough income for three families .
but we have a very pes@@ sim@@ istic approach about the cities . i &apos;m working in cities for almost 40 years , and where every may@@ or is trying to tell me his city is so big ,
market street , van ness and the water@@ front .
it &apos;s not enough , a new materials . it &apos;s not enough , new sources of energy .
i &apos;m working in a museum and also a multi-@@ use city , because you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day .
it &apos;s important starting and having the contribu@@ tion from people , and they could teach you if you &apos;re not in the right track .
and i think if people don &apos;t believe it , they should get out more . but i believe there &apos;s a second climate crisis , which is as sev@@ ere , which has the same orig@@ ins , and that we have to deal with with the same ur@@ gency .
you have to create the circum@@ st@@ ances where they show themselves .
and many of our ideas have been formed , not to meet the circum@@ st@@ ances of this century , but to c@@ ope with the circum@@ st@@ ances of previous cent@@ u@@ ries .
as she says , &quot; it &apos;s a single function device . &quot;
this one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
see , it &apos;s ou@@ trage@@ ous as a conception , but it &#91; un@@ clear &#93; .
you know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
thank you .
and they did it in a total dev@@ o@@ tion to non-@@ violence .
so we all know the three o &apos;@@ clock in the morning syndrome , when something you &apos;ve been wor@@ rying about wa@@ kes you up -- i see a lot of people -- and for an hour you to@@ ss and turn , it gets worse and worse , and by four o &apos;@@ clock you &apos;re pin@@ ned to the pil@@ low by a mon@@ ster this big .
and they &apos;re doing what they think is best .
and chris hu@@ gh@@ es str@@ ode into the middle of the thr@@ ong with his wea@@ pon above his head , point@@ ing at the ground , and he said , &quot; k@@ ne@@ el . &quot; and these huge soldiers with their back@@ p@@ acks and their body ar@@ mor , w@@ ob@@ bl@@ ed to the ground .
we can bring to an end the b@@ loo@@ di@@ est century that humanity has ever known .
it is dimen@@ sion@@ less . it is limit@@ less .
you can see i don &apos;t do much . i &apos;m just standing there , again with my eyes closed , and other people are mol@@ ding me , ev@@ identi@@ al .
i think of it as a 21@@ st-@@ century bu@@ dd@@ ha .
at his car@@ pet company , ray anderson has increas@@ ed sales and doubl@@ ed profits while turning the traditional &quot; take / make / waste &quot; industrial system on its head . in a gent@@ le , underst@@ ated way , he shares a powerful vision for sustainable commerce .
and the@@ ft of our children &apos;s future would some@@ day be a crime .
in the new industrial revolution extr@@ active must be re@@ placed by ren@@ e@@ w@@ able ; lin@@ ear by cy@@ cli@@ cal ; fossil fuel energy by ren@@ e@@ w@@ able energy , sunlight ;
three years ago we launched car@@ pet tile for the home , under the brand flo@@ r , mis@@ sp@@ ell@@ ed f-@@ l-@@ o-@@ r .
there is a di@@ p there , from 2001 to 2003 : a di@@ p when our sales , over a three-@@ year period , were down 17 percent .
if we can actually do it , it must be possible .
tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve just beg@@ un to think of you and of your good , though always having known i should .
and now , a typical university ent@@ ering student arri@@ ves at college already having spent 20@@ ,000 hours online and an ad@@ di@@ tional 10,000 hours playing video games -- a star@@ k re@@ min@@ der that we operate in a cultural context where video games now out@@ sell music and movie recor@@ dings combin@@ ed .
now , go to youtube , facebook ; you have worldwide distribution without leaving the priv@@ acy of your own be@@ dro@@ om .
we work to prom@@ ote healthy vibr@@ ant societies , to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate human suffering , to prom@@ ote a more thou@@ ght@@ ful , subst@@ an@@ tive , empath@@ ic world order .
bill stric@@ k@@ land makes change with a slide show
well , we don &apos;t make any steel anymore , and the people who used to make the steel are having a very tough time of it .
that we have qu@@ il@@ ts and clay and cal@@ li@@ graph@@ y and everywhere your eye turns , there &apos;s something beautiful looking back at you ,
we &apos;ve heard about your work with the kids and the ex@@ -@@ steel workers , and we &apos;re in@@ clin@@ ed to want to support your desire to build a new building .
it &apos;s all in the way that you think about people that often deter@@ mines their behavior .
well , i went out and decided to re@@ produce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood , the theory being if you get kids f@@ lowers and you give them food and you give them sun@@ sh@@ ine and en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m , you can bring them right back to life .
i can &apos;t get these parents to come to the school . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , there &apos;s an easy solution to that problem . &quot;
and jo@@ e willi@@ ams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoul@@ der and he said , &quot; god &apos;s picked you , man , to do this work . and i want my music to be with you . &quot;
and that &apos;s the building , and that &apos;s the model , and on the right &apos;s a high-@@ tech green@@ house and in the middle &apos;s the medical technology building .
and said , &quot; mr. stric@@ k@@ land , you ought to get the civi@@ c leader of the year a@@ ward because you &apos;ve appreci@@ ated our property values beyond our wil@@ dest expect@@ ations .
and along the way , i met this real short guy at my slide show in the silicon valley .
but i met a guy named qu@@ inc@@ y j@@ ones along the way and i showed him the box of sli@@ des .
in my business it &apos;s very difficult work . you &apos;re always fighting up@@ stream like a sal@@ mon -- never enough money , too much need --
well it turns out you have 100 times more bacter@@ ial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life .
the question that we had is how can bacteria , these prim@@ itive organisms , tell the difference from times when they &apos;re alone , and times when they &apos;re in a community , and then all do something together .
and as the day goes by the bacteria double , they release the molecule , and then light comes on at night , exactly when the s@@ qui@@ d wants it .
the le@@ f@@ t-@@ hand part of the molecule is identi@@ cal in every single species of bacteria .
it &apos;s a very small , fi@@ ve-@@ carbon molecule .
the hope is that these will be used as broad@@ -@@ spectrum antibio@@ tics
this is exactly what happens in your body .
information . that is , how it takes information in from the outside world , and conver@@ ts it into patterns of electrical activity , and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things -- to see , hear , to reach for an object .
so , a solution to the problem , then , would be to build a device that could mim@@ ic the actions of that fron@@ t-@@ end circu@@ i@@ try and send signals to the re@@ tin@@ a &apos;s out@@ put cells , and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain .
so i &apos;m just going to show you one bot@@ tom@@ -@@ line experiment that answers this , and of course i &apos;ve got a lot of other data , so if you &apos;re interested i &apos;m happy to show more . so the experiment is called a re@@ construction experiment .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and if not , stu@@ x@@ net does nothing .
and that worked pretty well .
down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the cen@@ tri@@ fu@@ ges .
just spread it as wide as possible .
if you think about the argu@@ ments we have ,
ms : the worst flu@@ te players .
he was a very good gol@@ fer , but he had a dis@@ ability .
ms : char@@ lie says --
and what do you suppose they all said ?
but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except am@@ usement , that is , what distin@@ gu@@ ish@@ es games from productive activity , it is quite impossible to say that any of a game &apos;s ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary rules is essential . &quot;
the op@@ pon@@ ents of sam@@ e-@@ sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage , fundament@@ ally , is pro@@ creation ,
in the classroom , we have argu@@ ments on some of the most fi@@ er@@ cel@@ y held moral convic@@ tions that students have about big public questions .
nam@@ ely , essentially an el@@ im@@ in@@ ation of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed , to get sick in the first place .
these are the sorts of un@@ believ@@ able exc@@ uses that people give for aging .
and the fundamental answer is that the pro@@ -@@ aging tr@@ ance is not as du@@ m@@ b as it looks .
we &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , r@@ na inter@@ ference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental compon@@ ent of how cells work .
you can look at medical care . i mean , hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e , vacc@@ ines , antibio@@ tics -- you know , the same sort of time frame .
and in order to do that , i need to talk about mi@@ ce a little bit .
that will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inev@@ itable in humans , since it &apos;s been pos@@ t@@ pon@@ ed so very effectively in mi@@ ce .
the list on the right is also in@@ complete .
so , you know , you &apos;ve got to actually do your hom@@ ework , in order to understand whether this is true .
so , to the ex@@ tent that evolution doesn &apos;t matter , doesn &apos;t care whether genes are passed on by individuals , living a long time or by pro@@ creation , there &apos;s a certain amount of modu@@ lation of that , which is why different species have different lif@@ esp@@ ans , but that &apos;s why there are no im@@ mor@@ tal species .
but in the last couple of years we &apos;ve become in@@ famous for a couple of things .
what does that mean ?
einstein said that this was the definition of in@@ san@@ ity -- to do the same things over and over again , hoping for a different out@@ come .
so we should embr@@ ace our difference and aim for challenge . the final thought i want to leave with you is that i &apos;m f@@ ed up with this ty@@ r@@ anny of either / or choices in life -- either it &apos;s men or it &apos;s women .
ex@@ tern@@ al deb@@ t -- something that i can tell you a long story about because i personally worked on one of the biggest deb@@ ts on the continent -- has come down dra@@ ma@@ tically .
like in every other country where this has been done , jobs is the top issue .
i don &apos;t think that afri@@ cans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid .
well , i was in the middle of it .
in about two to three hours , she started to move .
resources that were trans@@ fer@@ red to them -- and were the sp@@ an@@ ish ash@@ am@@ ed of this ? no !
but i &apos;m not really sure that their ass@@ istance is also being ch@@ ann@@ eled in the right way .
ten years from now we will have the same story , and we will be repe@@ ating the same things .
you are un@@ discipl@@ ined . &quot;
we have i@@ bu@@ k@@ un aw@@ o@@ si@@ ka in nigeria , with the chair company .
and so why don &apos;t we go and click the video .
i think that neuro@@ scientists have many more questions than answers ,
we actually have to come up with a scientific experiment .
as i like to say , these are not the &quot; jazz areas &quot; of the brain .
the fact that we do it over and over again lets you ac@@ climate to your surr@@ oun@@ dings .
and so this is what you do : you have a fre@@ e-@@ style artist come in and mem@@ or@@ ize a ra@@ p that you write for them , that they &apos;ve never heard before , and then you have them fre@@ e-@@ style .
you have he@@ igh@@ ten@@ ed brain activity when you &apos;re doing a compar@@ able task , when that one task is creative and the other task is mem@@ or@@ ized .
on the other hand , statistics -- that &apos;s a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . right ?
and what better way to do this than by inter@@ pre@@ ting the signals naturally produced by our brain , our center for control and experience .
so fac@@ ial expressions -- as i mentioned before in emotional experiences -- are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensi@@ tivity ad@@ just@@ ments available for person@@ alization .
so we have a little bit of time available , so i &apos;m going to ask ev@@ an to do a really difficult task .
and moving on to some applications developed by develop@@ ers and researchers around the world , with robots and simple machines , for example -- in this case , flying a to@@ y hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter simply by thinking &quot; lif@@ t &quot; with your mind .
the two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn &apos;t fun , you wouldn &apos;t have the time to do it .
so the inside of this thing actually looks like a co@@ ke machine .
it &apos;s got this sort of so@@ ap oper@@ a-@@ like lifes@@ ty@@ le ;
it creates a very high peak power
this is malaria sp@@ reading across ma@@ d@@ ag@@ as@@ car .
your laser print@@ er has a mirror gal@@ van@@ om@@ eter that &apos;s used to ste@@ er a laser bea@@ m very accur@@ ately ;
but the female needs the blood m@@ eal .
here we have it running at high-@@ speed mode .
and i &apos;ve spent a long time , 25 years , prepar@@ ing these .
if they &apos;re not working , put a shel@@ f on it , which i did ,
this is the waste room .
and it &apos;s run on hydro@@ electricity , so i &apos;ve gone from air to water .
really important .
so , i &apos;m an artist .
and it just takes a quick , quick second .
and i don &apos;t know , i think this project has a lot of possibilities , and i encourage you all to record just a small s@@ ni@@ pp@@ et of your life every day , so you can never forget that that day , you lived .
this is a new generation , a new family , which is able to store the win@@ ds .
and what &apos;s very important is this tube . it suc@@ ks in air normally , but when it s@@ wal@@ lows water , it feels the res@@ istance of it .
it also is the first species to have its own website en@@ co@@ ded in its genetic code .
there were several steps to this . there were two sides :
and we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosom@@ es out of y@@ east and trans@@ plant them .
so , we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule cont@@ amin@@ ation of the n@@ ative chromosome , leading us to believe that we actually had created a syn@@ thetic cell , when it would have been just a cont@@ amin@@ ant .
the last thing i want to say before turning it over to questions is that the ex@@ ten@@ sive work that we &apos;ve done -- asking for eth@@ ical re@@ view , push@@ ing the envelop@@ e on that side as well as the technical side -- this has been broad@@ ly discus@@ sed in the scientific community , in the policy community and at the highest levels of the fe@@ der@@ al government .
we can &apos;t see co2 -- we de@@ pend on scientific measu@@ rements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it --
my last book was about the story behind the sh@@ i &apos;@@ a-@@ sun@@ ni sp@@ lit , and for that i &apos;d worked clo@@ sely with the ear@@ li@@ est islam@@ ic histor@@ ies ,
and where the bible is ad@@ dr@@ essed exclu@@ si@@ vely to men , using the second and third person mas@@ cul@@ ine , the k@@ or@@ an inclu@@ des women -- talking , for instance , of believ@@ ing men and believ@@ ing women , hon@@ or@@ able men and hon@@ or@@ able women .
par@@ a@@ dise is quite the opposite .
and every colon@@ y has a name , which is a number , which is paint@@ ed on a rock . and i go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before , and figure out which ones have died , and put all the new ones on the map .
they make a midd@@ en , a pile of refu@@ se -- mostly the hus@@ ks of the see@@ ds that they eat .
that is , that there are cham@@ bers inside , they line the walls of the cham@@ bers with mo@@ ist soil and it dri@@ es to a kind of an ado@@ be@@ -@@ like surface in it .
that is to say , if something happened -- and i &apos;ve never seen anything like this happen , but i &apos;ve only been looking for 20 years -- if something happened , they might all come out if they were needed .
then we repe@@ ated all those experiments with the ants mar@@ ked .
this process changes with colon@@ y age , and it changes like this .
but first you might be wondering : how is it that an ant can tell , for example , i &apos;m a for@@ ager .
again , i don &apos;t want to say that this kind of hap@@ h@@ az@@ ard pattern of interactions produ@@ ces a factory that works with the precis@@ ion and efficiency of clo@@ ck@@ work .
and what &apos;s interesting about it isn &apos;t the cost ; it &apos;s the way it en@@ co@@ des the internet .
v@@ on neu@@ mann , in the &apos; 5@@ 0s , did the same thing for computing ;
you know , hundreds of people came in beg@@ ging , all my life i &apos;ve been waiting for this class ; i &apos;ll do anything to do it .
the students hi@@ jac@@ ked all the machines i bought to do personal fabrication .
they invented a way to do a construction k@@ it out of a car@@ d@@ board box -- which , as you see up there , that &apos;s becoming a business -- but their design was better than sau@@ l &apos;s design at mit , so there &apos;s now three students at mit doing their thes@@ es on scal@@ ing the work of ei@@ ght-@@ year-old children because they had better designs .
the real opportunity is to har@@ ness the inv@@ enti@@ ve power of the world to lo@@ cally design and produce solutions to local problems .
a hundred years ago we were looking at coal , of course , and we were looking at wh@@ ale oil and we were looking at cru@@ de oil .
are we smar@@ ter than anybody else ? i &apos;m not sure .
if you go forward the next 10 years and cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a bar@@ rel , you will pay 2.@@ 2 trillion .
how does that trans@@ late to bar@@ rel@@ s of oil equivalent ?
if that &apos;s the way you &apos;re going to go , that there &apos;s pl@@ enty of meth@@ ane --
we found out that we could go to the source rock , which were the car@@ bon@@ i@@ fer@@ ous sh@@ ales in the bas@@ ins .
but jim and i talked there as he left ,
you can &apos;t -- okay .
your picture then i guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fu@@ els is through innovation ultimately , that we &apos;ll some@@ day make solar and nuclear cost competi@@ tive ?
i think there &apos;s a lot of people who will want to engage with you .
but they keep hearing about people getting rich , and then in 18@@ 50 they still hear that . and they think it &apos;s not real .
it got ren@@ am@@ ed the &quot; dead horse tr@@ ail . &quot;
it &apos;s not a specific thing .
by the way , this is the beginning of the as@@ bes@@ to@@ s law@@ suit .
and you &apos;d plu@@ g it in there .
but , you know , before i get too far into con@@ dem@@ ning our ancest@@ ors , i thought i &apos;d show you : this is my conference room .
because , you know , res@@ ili@@ ence -- if you think of it in terms of the gold rus@@ h , then you &apos;d be pretty de@@ pressed right now
so , i &apos;m going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language , and so it &apos;s not going to sound as warm and fu@@ zz@@ y as your average compassion talk .
again , i know this is not as inspir@@ ing a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past , but from a biolog@@ ist &apos;s point of view , this reci@@ pro@@ cal al@@ tru@@ ism kind of compassion is ultimately self-@@ ser@@ ving too .
we have the capacity to car@@ ve out excep@@ tions , put people in a special categ@@ ory .
now , if you &apos;re playing dou@@ bles , then the person on your side of the net is in a non-@@ zer@@ o-@@ sum relationship with you , because every point is either good for both of you -- positive , win@@ -@@ win -- or bad for both of you , it &apos;s lo@@ se-@@ lose .
and you compare that to the attitude now , i think part of that is due to a kind of economic inter@@ depend@@ ence .
that &apos;s good , but again we tend to de@@ plo@@ y it sel@@ ec@@ tively .
in oxford in the 195@@ 0s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named al@@ ice ste@@ war@@ t .
and it fle@@ w in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t har@@ m them .
they saw it as thinking .
because it does take skill and practice , too .
it doesn &apos;t really matter what the stat@@ ements are about , what matters is that the candi@@ d@@ ates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
and the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely del@@ icious .
and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain , so we got looking in the dry areas of the sou@@ th@@ west .
then there &apos;s the point of embar@@ k@@ ation , that is , the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pil@@ gri@@ m on a qu@@ est .
there &apos;s possibilities . the bor@@ ders are important .
well , a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth , and by and by , thanks to mit@@ ch and j@@ ay , we were able to buy the whole property for 14@@ 0,000 dollars .
way more interesting than monter@@ ey even today .
where there &apos;s a bit of a problem .
and it really is hidden . i can &apos;t find it in this image , and i &apos;m not sure you can .
he &apos;s trying to deter@@ mine if where he is on a bit of long now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain .
you exc@@ av@@ ated from somewhere , came up from inside and dee@@ pen@@ ed it .
i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting .
the color of movies and the way light makes the colors , light from behind the proj@@ ection , or light from the proj@@ ection , makes the colors look so impossible .
it &apos;s sort of an ex@@ cer@@ pt from a quote of h@@ ers .
i work with tw@@ y@@ la th@@ ar@@ p a lot , and i work with mark mor@@ r@@ is a lot , who is one of my best friends .
and if you ever get bo@@ red you can look at another thing , and do another thing and talk about it , right ?
and there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , ro@@ sie . because just because if you &apos;re fabul@@ ously rich , and fabul@@ ously famous , does that mean you shouldn &apos;t have kids , because you know they &apos;re going to end up getting mess@@ ed up ?
and so i think that &apos;s what it all bo@@ ils down to .
just because i don &apos;t know that whole -- that there &apos;s no such thing as whole but@@ ter@@ milk .
i want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in mus@@ lim@@ -@@ majority societies .
at the age of 21 , i was co-@@ foun@@ ding this organization in pakistan .
and so they are po@@ ck@@ ets of paro@@ chi@@ alism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are ma@@ inst@@ re@@ am .
so the ideas and the narr@@ atives of al-@@ q@@ a@@ ed@@ a come to your mind immediately .
and what happens as a result of this is , when those parties are el@@ ected , and inev@@ it@@ ably they fail , or inev@@ it@@ ably they make political mistakes , democracy takes the bl@@ ame for their political mistakes .
without freedom of belief , you don &apos;t have the right to join organizations .
n@@ and@@ an n@@ il@@ e@@ k@@ an@@ i , the visi@@ onary co-@@ foun@@ der of out@@ sour@@ cing pion@@ e@@ er in@@ fo@@ sy@@ s , explains four br@@ ands of ideas that will deter@@ mine whether india can continue its recent break@@ nec@@ k progress .
and i believe this change in the min@@ d@@ set , of looking at people as something of a bur@@ den to human capital , has been one of the fundamental changes in the indian min@@ d@@ set .
the next thing is technology .
for some reason , whatever reason -- lack of money , lack of pri@@ ori@@ ties , because of religion having an older culture -- primary education was never given the focus it requi@@ red .
again , an idea which is arrived , but not yet impl@@ ement@@ ed .
at the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the forma@@ l sector , and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for .
on a population of nine billion our average carbon emis@@ sion will have to be about two tons per year .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
ok , this is the route up ever@@ est .
that way , it &apos;s less likely to tum@@ ble down on you .
everybody &apos;s on oxygen , your sup@@ pli@@ es are limited , and you either have to go up or go down , make that decision very quickly .
you can see on this clim@@ ber , we have two oxygen tan@@ ks in the back@@ pack -- little ti@@ tan@@ ium tan@@ ks , very ligh@@ t@@ weight --
and we heard that ro@@ b was ok , but dou@@ g was too wea@@ k to come down .
so , as the clim@@ bers came by me , i sort of ass@@ essed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down .
the surviv@@ ors came in one by one .
after l@@ aying in the snow that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp .
there &apos;s very little red anywhere .

and plus , i &apos;m not going to give you any answers .
democracy is the only game in town .
and this is not the audience to which i &apos;m going to pre@@ ach to what ex@@ tent the internet em@@ powered people .
and it &apos;s becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are not like you .
this is why you have chec@@ ks and bal@@ ances .

i think when major h told me , i wasn &apos;t really totally gather@@ ing what that would mean .
soldiers : i@@ v ! are we on fire ? i@@ v !
i don &apos;t know how many of you might imagine it , but there &apos;s actually a ted@@ ster who recently got back from iraq .
i didn &apos;t save all of them , because i didn &apos;t realize at the beginning that it would be something that i would want to keep track of .
get your ba@@ g , get your ba@@ g !
i &apos;ll do that , then i &apos;m g@@ onn@@ a jer@@ k off .
i knew about that journal , but it was very , very private .
and usually , the first questions are , &quot; oh , what kind of cameras did you use ? &quot;
so when i talk about a dis@@ connect , it &apos;s not only for maybe those people who don &apos;t know a soldi@@ er ,
this is what we call , in our lab , sensible design .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of mi@@ ch@@ el@@ angel@@ o ...
z@@ id@@ ane , the head@@ but@@ t in a moment .
and if we show that to people , then we can also prom@@ ote some behavi@@ oral change .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sens@@ ors stopped working .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pix@@ els .
yeah ? and then a swe@@ dish guy showed me my room .
i &apos;m going to be all right . &quot; q@@ at@@ ar@@ is , you guys do the no@@ se to no@@ se .
even if i &apos;m there with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; gre@@ et@@ ings , jack . sal@@ u@@ tations , jack . &quot; never &quot; hi , jack . &quot; but now appar@@ ently we can &apos;t even talk about the saf@@ est place to sit on an airplane .
which is exactly what we &apos;ve done .
you probably had no idea . it &apos;s like driving around the world six times .
for me , today , on this date , it &apos;s like a second bar mit@@ z@@ v@@ ah experience .
but ul@@ tr@@ as@@ ound can be shaped to be anything in between , because it &apos;s a mechan@@ ical force .
and about four or five months ago , he under@@ went an experiment@@ al proce@@ dure .
so the first son@@ i@@ cation is at lower energy .

he took the treatment , and on the way back , he dro@@ ve the tru@@ ck by himself .
well , there are other cancer tum@@ ors in the ab@@ dom@@ en -- quite le@@ thal , very le@@ thal actually -- pan@@ cre@@ as , li@@ ver , kid@@ ney .
copyright law &apos;s gri@@ p on film , music and software bar@@ ely tou@@ ches the fashion industry ... and fashion benefits in both innovation and sales , says joh@@ ann@@ a bl@@ ak@@ ley . at tedx@@ us@@ c 2010 , she talks about what all creative industries can learn from fashion &apos;s free culture .
and sometimes these are fun , right ?
so it &apos;s both a top@@ -@@ down and a bot@@ tom@@ -up kind of industry .
and this , actually , is good news to tr@@ end@@ set@@ ters ;
i love these gal@@ li@@ an@@ os .
so , that does not stop the kno@@ ck@@ -@@ off artists .
tat@@ too artists , they don &apos;t want it ; it &apos;s not cool .
the other one is : is it an idea ?
it also happens to be a relative of par@@ s@@ ley .
and then , of course , there &apos;s the li@@ ch@@ ens .
imagine that it &apos;s one giant ro@@ ot system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system .
and there are actually a number or ancient y@@ e@@ ws in chur@@ ch@@ y@@ ards around the u.k. , but if you do the math , you &apos;ll remember it &apos;s actually the y@@ e@@ w trees that were there first , then the chur@@ ches .
it &apos;s bu@@ sh@@ felt region , which is dry and pr@@ one to a lot of fi@@ res , as so what these trees have done is , if you can imagine that this is the cro@@ wn of the tree , and that this is ground level , imagine that the whole thing , that whole bul@@ k of the tree , migr@@ ated under@@ ground , and you just have those leaves pe@@ e@@ ping up above the surface .
i &apos;m trying to travel there to find 5,000 year-old mo@@ ss , which lives on the ant@@ arc@@ tic pen@@ in@@ su@@ la .
i &apos;ve added my location with a google map , and it &apos;s live , so try moving it around .
mi@@ k@@ ko hy@@ p@@ pon@@ en : three types of online attack
this is b@@ j@@ or@@ n sun@@ d@@ in .
now we all , or a big part of us , use g@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ itarian states like iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like g@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over ss@@ l connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ op on their discussions .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
one woman i knew who was a fellow at a program that i ran at the ro@@ c@@ ke@@ fel@@ ler foundation was named ing@@ rid wash@@ in@@ a@@ wat@@ ok .
i also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership .
what we really year@@ n for as human beings is to be visible to each other .
for two years , he har@@ dly made any money , a tiny sti@@ pend , but he appr@@ enti@@ ced with this incredible hou@@ sing develop@@ er named tas@@ ne@@ em sad@@ di@@ qui .
my final story is about a young , beautiful man named jo@@ se@@ ph@@ at by@@ ar@@ u@@ hang@@ a , who was another acu@@ men fund fellow , who h@@ ails from ug@@ anda , a farm@@ ing community .
so , what do you think ?
i &apos;ve made more than 1,@@ 100 por@@ traits myself for newsp@@ ap@@ ers , over the course of 300 -- 30 years , sorry , 30 years only .
the ic@@ on of ic@@ ons finally has a face .
by this age the brain can actually store .
in fact we do this in individuals of any age , in these different species --
such things in the early history of babies occu@@ r in real babies .
it had a success rate of about one in eight tries .
now actually we &apos;ve looked in several different cor@@ tical areas in the monkey learning this task .
enorm@@ ously different in the details from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago .
now i might say the noise problem could also occu@@ r on the basis of information provi@@ ded in the world from the ears .
the brain itself can be no@@ is@@ y . it &apos;s com@@ mon@@ ly no@@ is@@ y .
what we &apos;re most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution .
and what you see are subst@@ anti@@ al impro@@ vements of their immedi@@ ate memory , of their ability to remember things after a del@@ ay , of their ability to control their attention , their language abilities and visu@@ al-@@ spatial abilities .
ar@@ un@@ ach@@ al@@ am mu@@ ru@@ g@@ an@@ an@@ th@@ am : how i started a san@@ it@@ ary n@@ ap@@ k@@ in revolution !
they are not going to touch that , because it &apos;s not your matter .
arm@@ strong . then ten@@ zing &#91; and &#93; h@@ ill@@ ary , in ever@@ est ,
so far , 6@@ 30 install@@ ations happened in 23 states in six other countries .
not in front po@@ cket . i &apos;m a back po@@ cket man .
what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world , and show me just how fragile the world is .
the pass@@ eng@@ ers who fell off the ti@@ tan@@ ic fell into water of just five degrees centi@@ grade .
we all got down onto the ice , and i then got into my swimming co@@ stu@@ me and i di@@ ved into the sea .
for those of you who don &apos;t know him , he &apos;s the great british explorer .
and i went down into my ca@@ bin and i put on my swimming co@@ stu@@ me .
well done l@@ ad ! you did it ! you did it le@@ w@@ is !
we &apos;ve come a long way . we &apos;re doing good .
so , that &apos;s one of the stories of oil ; there &apos;s just a lot of it .
this is 200 years of history ,
it &apos;s an ab@@ alone sh@@ ell .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so this seemed like a problem that we could do something about .
we thought we had all our bases covered , we &apos;d done everything right .
there &apos;s one way to treat jau@@ n@@ di@@ ce , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called an exchange trans@@ fusion .
in fact that sounds kind of du@@ m@@ b .
so our goal is to study how they work , the resources they have access to , so that they can make this product .
these are the kinds of lessons --
fai@@ ling govern@@ ance in many areas : in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment , in the area of explo@@ itation of women and children , in the area of climate change ,
they were suddenly put together by con@@ sorti@@ a of ban@@ ks , of sup@@ pli@@ er ag@@ encies , of insur@@ ance ag@@ encies -- like in ger@@ many , her@@ mes , and so on -- and they came back very , very quickly , driven by an un@@ ho@@ ly alli@@ ance between the powerful el@@ ites in the countries there and the sup@@ pli@@ ers from the north .
and this is why i &apos;m telling you this : civil society rose to the occasion .
and , again , civil societies brea@@ thing down the nec@@ k of the estab@@ li@@ sh@@ ment .
this is why we have set up the govern@@ ance school and the center for civil society here in ber@@ lin ,
well , for one thing , we &apos;re a you@@ th-@@ obs@@ essed culture .
and he had never appeared in public since that point .
and i said , &quot; yeah . appar@@ ently i did . &quot;
she was a congr@@ ess@@ woman when there weren &apos;t very many congr@@ ess@@ women .
just with@@ ering in her con@@ temp@@ t .
his father was an so@@ b , and , in fact , he was another com@@ edi@@ an with an un@@ happy childhood , but then we were off and running .
agnes de mille is one of the great cho@@ re@@ ograp@@ h@@ ers in our history .
and she began to talk about her childhood , when she was beautiful , and she literally turned -- here she was , in this broken body -- and she turned to the audience and described her@@ self as the fair demo@@ is@@ elle with her red hair and her light steps and so forth , and then she said , &quot; and then pu@@ ber@@ ty hit . &quot;
in fact , most of the time i don &apos;t see it .
i first saw it when i was 19 , and i immediately went out and got a pos@@ ter of it , and in fact i still have that pos@@ ter . 30 years later it &apos;s hang@@ ing in my house .
well , who else would be in the house ?
these paint@@ ings took a long time to make .
and we may make a story , and it satis@@ fi@@ es us mom@@ ent@@ arily , but not really , and we come back again and again .
it &apos;s short .
&quot; i am 23 years old . it is time for me to mar@@ ry and produce an he@@ ir . it is expected of me . &quot; george dr@@ ained another glass of clar@@ et and turned to me .
and so i think i have to tell you just a few words , a few things about my personal life , because i think there is a connection .
i would like to show you six minutes .
lan@@ cel@@ ot ima@@ sen : but our films , they are stories that our people can relate to themselves .
and i discovered that i could be successful in life as an actor , without doing crime , without che@@ ating nobody , without telling no lies .
wer@@ ner her@@ zo@@ g , the ger@@ man fil@@ m@@ maker said , &quot; i need to make movies like you need oxygen . &quot;
so this is what i really think .
so imagine 45 films per week .
i &apos;m going to go right into the sli@@ des .
we even made flo@@ or@@ ing , walls and everything , out of car@@ d@@ board .
now , it &apos;s hard to do . it &apos;s hard to trans@@ late a fish form , because they &apos;re so beautiful -- perfect -- into a building or object like this .
and , finally , j@@ ay drag@@ ged me to my hom@@ et@@ own , tor@@ onto , canada .
we made it into a s@@ ail@@ ing craft .
and it was this interaction between that kind of , up@@ -@@ the-@@ ante stuff that became pretty interesting .
and they end up looking like stone .
instead of , like , cop@@ per in 10 or 15 .
that big metal thing is a passage , and in it is -- you go down@@ st@@ airs into the living room and then down into the be@@ dro@@ om , which is on the right .
and we had the opportunity to build a building on this site .
the dom@@ e was a requ@@ est from the client .
the material is lead cop@@ per , like in the building in boston .
in a very ti@@ ght , small -- this is the ground level .
it &apos;s like a drug ad@@ dic@@ t .
if it &apos;s going to be so bu@@ sy and crazy that you wouldn &apos;t show anything , and just wait .
these were the three buildings that were the id@@ eal -- the concer@@ t@@ ge@@ bou@@ w , boston and ber@@ lin .
larry hal@@ pr@@ in is doing the st@@ airs .
david by@@ r@@ ne sin@@ gs &quot; f@@ lowers &quot;
so not surpris@@ ingly , there &apos;s a lot of effort that &apos;s been done to look at alternative cooking fu@@ els .
and conven@@ i@@ ently , one of my students was from ghana , and he rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed a dish his mom used to make for him called &quot; k@@ ok@@ on@@ te , &quot; which is a very sti@@ cky por@@ ri@@ dge made out of the cass@@ av@@ a ro@@ ot .
there &apos;s a possibility of this being impl@@ ement@@ ed and saving a good por@@ tion of those .
so when we talk about , now , the future we will create , one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in .
as : yeah , i think its large numbers of people moving it forward .
and when you feed these kids bad food , that &apos;s what they &apos;re learning . so that &apos;s really what this is all about .
the us@@ da allows these antibio@@ tics , these hor@@ mon@@ es and these p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des in our food supply , and the us@@ da paid for this ad in time magazine .
and if that &apos;s not enough , they &apos;ve gone on to say , most before they graduate high school .
everything came in plastic , in car@@ d@@ board .
those are my hands . i get up at 4 a.@@ m. every day and go co@@ ok the food for the kids , because this is what we need to do .
we have cooking classes -- we have cooking class@@ rooms in our schools . and why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation , maybe two , of kids where one out of every four me@@ als is e@@ aten in fast food , one of every four me@@ als is e@@ aten in a car and one out of every last four me@@ als is e@@ aten in front of a tv or computer .
we really need to change it .
the national school lunch program sp@@ ends 8 billion dollars feeding 30 million children a year .
sit down and care .
there &apos;s a defin@@ ite difference .
the adults be@@ have more naturally , and the children play more read@@ ily with other children .
they were all perce@@ ived as being less than normal in all those character@@ is@@ tics -- more violent , etc . -- before the surgery .
he got married . he had a son called jer@@ em@@ i@@ ah .
after she had surgery to re@@ move the tumor , her parents dr@@ essed her in this beautiful green vel@@ v@@ et dress , a pin@@ k ri@@ b@@ bon in her hair , and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world , despite the fact that they were or@@ tho@@ do@@ x musli@@ ms and the mother wo@@ re a full bur@@ q@@ a .
this is an image of an@@ n who &apos;s had her right ja@@ w re@@ moved and the base of her sk@@ u@@ ll re@@ moved .
the face trans@@ plant has a role probably in bur@@ ns patients to re@@ place the skin .
and the best news of all is that surge@@ ons know that we need to do research .
and we had an exhi@@ bit of work that followed that .
so what you don &apos;t know is , we &apos;ve got these thousands of designers working around the world , connected basically by a website , and we have a staff of three .
we just don &apos;t know how to show this . &quot; so in a way , we had taken a pre-@@ exis@@ ting need and shown solutions .
they said , this is our design , because it &apos;s not only about engag@@ ing a community ; it &apos;s about em@@ power@@ ing a community and about getting them to be a part of the re@@ building process .
it &apos;s built by the parents of the kids .
quick to assemble . it &apos;s got a fla@@ p , that &apos;s the invention .
how do we improve the living standards of five billion people ?
i don &apos;t see that . i see the face of the world .
somebody said this a couple of years back .
i mean , it basically -- i haven &apos;t really thought of it .
you really reduce con@@ gestion quite subst@@ anti@@ ally .
well , so we did this huge interview surve@@ y with lots of travel services , and tried to figure out who changed , and where did they go ?
behind the destruction , i found a sou@@ l of places .
1@@ 3,000 girls studying here in the rooms under@@ ground , full of s@@ cor@@ pi@@ ons .
he said , &quot; be@@ z@@ os , i need you to go into the house . i need you to go up@@ st@@ airs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
it &apos;s , &quot; how can we give cre@@ di@@ ble hope to that billion people ? &quot;
before the war , america had been highly prot@@ ec@@ tion@@ ist .
between them , these new reven@@ ue flo@@ ws d@@ war@@ f aid .
the resource cur@@ se is entirely con@@ fin@@ ed to countries below a th@@ res@@ hold of govern@@ ance .
in all the societies of the bottom billion , there are intense strugg@@ les to do just that .
if you think about it , the cost of prom@@ ul@@ g@@ ating international rules is z@@ il@@ ch -- nothing .
nobody wants an operation .
now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the united states , sages , started in the late 199@@ 0s a training program that would as@@ sure that every surgeon who practi@@ ces minim@@ ally inv@@ a@@ sive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do proce@@ du@@ res .
if you think about the worldwide bur@@ den of trying to talk to your patients -- not just teaching surge@@ ons , just trying to talk to your patients -- there aren &apos;t enough transl@@ ators in the world .
i need to have a health care l@@ ex@@ ic@@ on .
all@@ an ok@@ rain@@ ec : today we &apos;re going to practice su@@ tur@@ ing .
in fact , after college i applied to seven art schools and was rej@@ ected by all seven .
i found a brilliant a@@ er@@ on@@ au@@ tical engineer who designs s@@ ails for america &apos;s cu@@ p rac@@ ing y@@ ach@@ ts named peter he@@ p@@ pe@@ l .
its title : &quot; 1.@@ 26 &quot; re@@ f@@ ers to the number of micro@@ seconds that the earth &apos;s day was shor@@ ten@@ ed .
ed@@ ward bur@@ ty@@ n@@ sky photographs the landscape of oil
so , to me , using photograph@@ y -- and i feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents , our ways of thinking , to begin to deal with what i think is probably one of the most challeng@@ ing issues of our time , how to deal with our energy crisis .
now you &apos;ve seen before that with elec@@ tro@@ des you can control robo@@ tic arms , that brain imag@@ ing and scann@@ ers can show you the insi@@ des of brains .
you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself , all your experiences . these are some of the areas we &apos;re working on today that i don &apos;t have time to go into in detail .
and there &apos;s no notion , no version of human mor@@ ality and human values that i &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point redu@@ ci@@ ble to a concer@@ n about conscious experience and its possible changes .
perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are struc@@ tured but other minds possibly could access them .
another thing to notice is there may be many pea@@ ks on the moral landscape : there may be equivalent ways to th@@ ri@@ ve ;
well , who are we not to say this ?
so , for instance the dal@@ ai lam@@ a gets up every morning me@@ dit@@ ating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integr@@ al compon@@ ent of human happiness .
so , this , i think , is what the world needs now .
and in@@ so@@ far as we begin to sh@@ ine light on that we are inev@@ it@@ ably going to conver@@ ge on that fact space .
and biological p@@ est control , by the way , or these good bu@@ gs that we are talking about , they &apos;ve exis@@ ted in the world for thousands and thousands of years , for a long , long time .
by the way , a m@@ eal for them for 24 hours is about five individuals of the spi@@ der m@@ ites , of the bad m@@ ites , or 15 to 20 eg@@ gs of the p@@ est m@@ ites .
but this is the end result .
and look , this flo@@ wer is f@@ loo@@ ded with predat@@ ory bu@@ gs , with the good ones after wi@@ ping out the bad ones , the th@@ ri@@ ps .
on the contr@@ ary , because we bring it to every cultural plo@@ t where the balance was already dis@@ rup@@ ted by the chemicals . here we come with those natural enem@@ ies in order to reverse a little bit of the whe@@ el and to bring more natural balance to the agri@@ cultural plo@@ t by re@@ duc@@ ing those chemicals .
if we take the over@@ all tur@@ no@@ ver of the bio@@ control industry worldwide , it &apos;s 250 million dollars .
and mean@@ while , i use non@@ sense , as you can see .
it &apos;s the only sp@@ an@@ ish innovation , techno@@ log@@ ically , of the 20th century , by the way .
hyper@@ bo@@ lic over@@ kill is a way of taking ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ation to the absolute ultimate lim@@ it , just for the fun of it . this was a piece i did -- a bro@@ ch@@ ure again -- &quot; r@@ ms ty@@ ran@@ ni@@ c : the biggest thing in all the world . &quot;
it &apos;s the little old lady that lives in a sho@@ e , and then this thing -- the title of that was , &quot; there goes the neighborhood . &quot;
what about ourselves ?
are there any general conclu@@ sions that ar@@ ise ?
one of the things that en@@ ab@@ led austr@@ alia to survive in this remote out@@ post of european civilization for 250 years has been their british identity .
why not eat insects ? well first , what are insects ?
they &apos;re at the start of food cha@@ ins .
but there &apos;s tom@@ ato@@ es that end up in a sou@@ p ,
and meat , in fact , is something that costs a lot of our agri@@ cultural production .
and because of their kind of reproduction , they can combine and produce a new virus .
and even in terms of cal@@ ories , it is very good .
there are a few people who don &apos;t like sh@@ ri@@ mp , but sh@@ ri@@ mp , or cr@@ ab@@ s , or cr@@ ay@@ fish , are very clo@@ sely related .
over to the h@@ ague recently , she went to a high-@@ class restaurant , and they ate insects all together .
but i am not as nervous as i was five weeks ago .
i wouldn &apos;t have my new hi@@ p for this ted .
yeah . they needed some young blood .
as technology progr@@ esses , and as it adv@@ ances , many of us assu@@ me that these adv@@ ances make us more intelligent , make us smar@@ ter and more connected to the world .
and the altitude correspon@@ ds to the plate system .
second , is you measure the altitude of den@@ e@@ b .
and what the as@@ tr@@ ol@@ ab@@ e does is it allows us , it affor@@ ds us , to connect to the night sky , to look up into the night sky and be much more -- to see the visible and the invisible together .
well , i think the first thing is that it re@@ minds us just how res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful people were , our fore@@ be@@ ars were , years and years ago .
and what you see over here is a very popular video game ,
the one in front , the smaller , is stri@@ der ii .
for most small whe@@ eled robots , they use a method called differ@@ enti@@ al ste@@ ering where the left and right whe@@ el turns the opposite direction .
we get so many vis@@ it@@ ors vis@@ iting our lab . so , when the vis@@ it@@ ors come , mars wal@@ ks up to the computer , starts ty@@ ping &quot; hel@@ lo , my name is mars . &quot;
but the cool part is the user interface .
there are no te@@ thers . it looks around , sear@@ ches for the ball , looks around , sear@@ ches for the ball , and it tries to play a game of so@@ c@@ cer , autonom@@ ously : artificial intelligence .
we truly believe this is going to be the very first running human@@ o@@ id robot in the united states . so , stay tu@@ ned .
but just a s@@ park of imagination is not good enough .
this picture in the back this is 3 a.@@ m. in the morning .
and we have environments where we have months of hu@@ mid@@ ity followed by months of dr@@ y@@ ness , and that is where des@@ er@@ ti@@ fication is occur@@ ring .
when i was a young man , a young biolog@@ ist in africa , i was involved in setting a@@ side mar@@ vel@@ ous areas as future national par@@ ks .
what we had failed to understand was that these seas@@ onal hu@@ mid@@ ity environments of the world , the soil and the veget@@ ation developed with very large numbers of gr@@ a@@ zing animals , and that these gr@@ a@@ zing animals developed with fer@@ o@@ ci@@ ous pack@@ -@@ hun@@ ting predat@@ ors .
when i first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use mu@@ ch@@ -@@ vi@@ li@@ fied li@@ ves@@ to@@ ck to address climate change and des@@ er@@ ti@@ fication , i was fac@@ ed with a real dilem@@ ma .
i began helping a family in the kar@@ o@@ o desert in the 197@@ 0s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to gr@@ ass@@ land , and than@@ k@@ fully , now their grand@@ children are on the land with hope for the future .
it &apos;s a little bit technical to explain here , but just that .
it &apos;s the depend@@ ence on farm sub@@ si@@ dies and under@@ -@@ per@@ forming schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban .
and only eight percent of the people in the coun@@ ty have a ba@@ ch@@ el@@ or &apos;s degree or higher .
but beyond our personal reasons for wan@@ ting to be there , there is a huge need .
so this game that the kids are playing here -- in this case they were learning basic multipli@@ cation through a game called match me .
it &apos;s hand@@ s-@@ on , it &apos;s in-@@ your@@ -@@ face , it requires an active engagement , and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways .
this is eric . he plays for the football team .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and the scientific mission would be to test the lim@@ its of visual plas@@ tic@@ ity .
and here &apos;s the same child three weeks post-@@ operation , with the right eye open .
what might be the caus@@ al connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones ?
the answer lies in motion and that &apos;s what i want to show you in the next clip .
the way we test dy@@ lan is by giving it in@@ puts , as i said , of the same kind that a baby , or a child in project pr@@ ak@@ ash would get .
even before the ball gets to a place , the child is already looking there .
they pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international aff@@ airs , and so i won a full ride to ge@@ org@@ et@@ own
he &apos;s co@@ ach@@ ed five olym@@ pi@@ ans , and the man &apos;s office is lin@@ ed from floor to ce@@ iling with all america certi@@ fic@@ ates of all these ath@@ let@@ es he &apos;s co@@ ach@@ ed . he &apos;s just a rather inti@@ mid@@ ating figure .
and i went out there and made it to the big east , which was sort of the cham@@ pion@@ ship race at the end of the seas@@ on . it was really , really hot .
i said , &quot; well , i just did it . no one told me that . &quot;
here we are , like , cr@@ ème de la cr@@ ème , and there is no doub@@ t about it , that i &apos;m going to lose big .
no , these are my cos@@ me@@ tic legs , actually , and they &apos;re absolutely beautiful .
ss : she can &apos;t really stand on these legs . she has to be moving , so ...
and it &apos;s really an amazing store . i got them a year and two weeks ago .
ro@@ b re@@ id : the $ 8 billion ipo@@ d
and this is just one of the many min@@ d-@@ blo@@ wing statistics that copyright mathematici@@ ans have to deal with every day .
governments realize that it &apos;s a big deal for our econom@@ ies , but don &apos;t know how to fix it .
to function in the world today , you &apos;ve got to be pretty quanti@@ t@@ ative , much more so than a few years ago :
see , crucial point here : math is not equal to calcul@@ ating .
i still do a lot of that , main@@ ly for estimat@@ ing .
a hundred years ago , it &apos;s certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechan@@ ics of the car and how the ig@@ ni@@ tion ti@@ ming worked and all sorts of things .
this is just nu@@ ts .
and we open up so many more possibilities .
and one of the reasons it &apos;s so important -- so it &apos;s very important to get computers in exam@@ s .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and people are starting to wake up about that .
but if you dis@@ played that on a cr@@ t or flat pan@@ el display , it would be meaning@@ less to hold up an ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ ary object , a real world object in that .
so this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the spatial operating environment , we call it .
here are some selection planes .
let &apos;s pull this apart :
we can &apos;t have adv@@ ances in technology any longer unless design is integr@@ ated from the very start .
and i understand what you &apos;re asking .
this was the worst month of my life .
i had je@@ wish bi@@ bles .
you know , i could spend a year not killing , but spending a year not go@@ ssi@@ ping , not co@@ v@@ eting , not lying -- you know , i live in new york , and i work as a journalis@@ t , so this was 75 , 80 percent of my day i had to do it .
how should we view the bible ?
so , whatever you think of cre@@ ation@@ ism -- and i think it &apos;s crazy -- they did a great job .
they have a p@@ am@@ ph@@ let that says , &quot; here &apos;s what j@@ es@@ us said about hom@@ os@@ exu@@ ality , &quot; and you open it up , and there &apos;s nothing in it .
i &apos;ve had some great me@@ als at caf@@ et@@ eri@@ as .
there is more information about what &apos;s going on in kenya right now than any one person can manage .
now , that free time exis@@ ted in the 20th century , but we didn &apos;t get us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di in the 20th century .
but media ab@@ un@@ dance never works that way .
and so the parents , quite sensi@@ bly , said , &quot; 10 she@@ k@@ els to pick my kid up late ?
us@@ ha@@ hi@@ di , by contr@@ ast , is civi@@ c value .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classi@@ cal s-@@ curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
and some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to in@@ corpor@@ ate chemicals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
so what was the next step ?
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time sp@@ an .
and these next steps , like electron@@ ics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
and let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combination analo@@ g@@ ous to sex . &quot; take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their su@@ br@@ out@@ ines , and the children in@@ her@@ it the traits of the su@@ br@@ out@@ ines of the two programs .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so conf@@ using .
so , the match was ended in between .
but slowly the game moved on , you know , finally .
and then another big accident happened in our cricket .
and then the gr@@ aci@@ ous people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
the new o@@ wn@@ ers of indian cricket were not the old pr@@ in@@ ces .
but what this also did was it started mar@@ rying the two most important things in indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in indian entertainment .
are they grain ?
now , this last minute before i go -- there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
now , this simple equ@@ ation , even for those of you who don &apos;t like equ@@ ations , is something that you &apos;re quite used to .
you kind of sh@@ out out the sound , s -- and the word comes .
there &apos;s 10 tick@@ ets in this lot@@ ter@@ y .
what you knew is , you paid three dollars in the past ; 25 is ou@@ trage@@ ous .
along the way , you lost something .
they &apos;re sitting in a room with po@@ ta@@ to chi@@ ps in front of them .
you &apos;ve all had this experience .
that is , they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of per@@ cents in order to del@@ ay grati@@ fication and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars .
people always think more is better than less : 60 is always better than 50 , and they always think now is better than later :
i tried to point out to them that terror@@ ism was a name based on people &apos;s psycho@@ logical reaction to a set of events , and that if they were concerned about terror@@ ism they might ask what causes ter@@ ror and how can we stop people from being terri@@ fied , rather than -- not rather than , but in addition to stop@@ ping the a@@ tro@@ cities that we &apos;re all concerned about .
i mean , this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terror@@ ism and not be quite as up@@ set by it , shall i say , as those of us who have not had many ter@@ ror att@@ acks .
my guess is that there &apos;s nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past . but rather , if you &apos;re looking for an evolutionary explanation , you might say that most organisms are ne@@ o-@@ pho@@ bi@@ c -- that is , they &apos;re a little scar@@ ed of stuff that &apos;s new and different .
ad@@ g : in persu@@ ading them .
and this is bat@@ ti@@ st@@ a .
and i really strugg@@ led with this one .
so here &apos;s what it says in my explanation at the bottom left .
so that &apos;s one thing , to introduce the idea of doub@@ t into graph@@ ics .
now this says , &quot; note to the vie@@ wer : i thought i might use a visual cli@@ che of our time -- ma@@ gr@@ it@@ te &apos;s every@@ man -- to express the idea that art is myster@@ y , continu@@ ity and history .
and if we wanted to zoom into a page , we can just open it up .
it also runs on the iphone .
the previous spea@@ ker has , i think , really paint@@ ed a very good background as to the impul@@ se behind my work and what dri@@ ves me , and my sense of loss , and trying to find the answer to the big questions .
mar@@ cus : you ’ re a r@@ app@@ er , am i right ?
i &apos;ve not been home for quite a while , for about five years now .
am@@ ph@@ et@@ am@@ ines .
you know what you are ? a cro@@ co@@ di@@ le .
c@@ c : mr. g@@ ele@@ h@@ un , i ’ d like to re@@ mind you you ’ re not on trial here for any cri@@ mes you commit@@ ted .
em@@ e@@ ka ok@@ a@@ for : thank you , newton .
and the glass -- lu@@ ck@@ ily i turned around -- i had it all in my back
and i realized when i &apos;d come into the me@@ et@@ ings with these corru@@ g@@ ated metal and chain link stuff , and people would just look at me like i &apos;d just land@@ ed from mars . but i couldn &apos;t do anything else .
i &apos;ve got 120 people
f@@ g : that will be finished in 2003 -- september , octo@@ ber --
si@@ z@@ a , on the other hand , continu@@ ed in por@@ tu@@ g@@ al where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that rel@@ ates to that histor@@ ic language .
i &apos;d seen dra@@ wings you had present@@ ed here at ted .
and his secre@@ t@@ ary , who was kind of a hell on whe@@ els type lady , called me and said , &quot; mr. si@@ mon &apos;s sitting at his des@@ k and the water &apos;s coming in on his head . &quot; and i told her the frank l@@ lo@@ y@@ d wright story .
usually i say no right away , but some of them come with pe@@ di@@ gre@@ e and they sound well-@@ int@@ enti@@ oned
f@@ g : can i say something ?
and i kept being suc@@ ked into this genre of the cal@@ end@@ ar picture , or something of that nature , and i couldn &apos;t get away from it .
to say , &quot; wow , this is beautiful , &quot; on one level ,
and saw for the first time a third world , a view of it , that i had never actually thought was possible .
and again , it &apos;s actually a reli@@ ef for what &apos;s going on in china because i think on the table right now , there &apos;s 27 nuclear power stations to be built .
so this is a pin@@ k uni@@ form at this factory . it &apos;s a sho@@ e factory .
there &apos;s 9@@ ,000 of them here , and they &apos;re being built for most of the big cities , be@@ i@@ j@@ ing and shanghai , sh@@ enz@@ h@@ en .
in that one , there were 400 people that worked on the floor .
and they don &apos;t want to let me in .
it &apos;s re@@ fer@@ red to as &quot; e-@@ waste &quot; there .
and it just started about 14 months ago . and the beauty of what &apos;s going on there is that the t@@ one of the conversation is the t@@ one that i like .
but to use that as pr@@ iz@@ es for kids to get into their hands .
i want to start my talk today with two observ@@ ations about the human species .
because we &apos;re a smart species , we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super , super complicated , sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand , even though we &apos;ve actually created them .
you know , she &apos;s a smart , very cut creature , a prim@@ ate as well , but she l@@ acks all the stuff we think might be mess@@ ing us up .
it was us@@ eless to the mon@@ keys at first before they realized what they could do with it .
upon ent@@ ering the market -- it was actually a much more fun market for the mon@@ keys than most human markets because , as the mon@@ keys ent@@ ered the door of the market , a human would give them a big wall@@ et full of to@@ k@@ ens so they could actually trade the to@@ k@@ ens with one of these two guys here -- two different possible human sal@@ es@@ men that they could actually buy stuff from .
the other thing we also spontan@@ e@@ ously saw , embarrass@@ ingly enough , is spontan@@ e@@ ous evidence of lar@@ cen@@ y .
you might say , eh , that &apos;s not really ir@@ rational .
and this leads to the second bi@@ as , which econom@@ ists have called loss aver@@ sion .
do the mon@@ keys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who &apos;s going to do the same thing on every trial , or do they want to be ris@@ ky and try to get a ris@@ ky , but big , bon@@ us , but risk the possibility of getting no bon@@ us .
but they also do some of the ir@@ rational things we do .
when you &apos;re watching your stoc@@ ks plu@@ m@@ met into the red , when you &apos;re watching your house price go down , you &apos;re not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms .
think back when you were just a kid .
most of what &apos;s extr@@ acted from our end@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ life stuff , if it makes it to a recycl@@ er , are the met@@ als . to put that in perspective -- and i &apos;m using steel as a pro@@ x@@ y here for met@@ als , because it &apos;s the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycl@@ er , probably over 90 percent of the met@@ als are going to be re@@ covered and re@@ used for another purpose .
i call this environmental ar@@ bi@@ tr@@ age .
and because we &apos;re not breaking down the plastic into molecules and re@@ combin@@ ing them , we &apos;re using a min@@ ing approach to extr@@ act the materials .
we bl@@ end it in 5@@ 0@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ l@@ b@@ . bl@@ ending sil@@ os .
and if someone happened to be missing , we would have to , we say , &quot; fix a plate &quot; for that person , put it in the o@@ ven , then we could say gr@@ ace , and we could eat .
we thought he must be out of his mind .
suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and s@@ ist@@ ers without the accidents of our birth or our eth@@ nic@@ ity rob@@ bing us of a sense of un@@ ity of being .
and they all spoke out of their own traditions , a word about the heal@@ ing power of soli@@ dar@@ ity , one with the other . &quot;
but now , to be a good sam@@ ar@@ it@@ an -- and i always say , and to be a good american -- for me , is not simply to con@@ gratu@@ late myself for the individual acts of care . compassion takes on a corpor@@ ate dynamic .
so i have br@@ and@@ ed myself as a war child .
lu@@ ck@@ ily now things have changed
i knew it was ru@@ de , but we needed food .
don &apos;t even know the day i &apos;ll ever return .
so now i &apos;m doing music so i know what the power of music is .
as a nation we have been cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed .
she said the only way to help su@@ dan is to invest in the women , educ@@ ating them , educ@@ ating the children ,
and we have not thought enough about the solutions .
he &apos;d be asking us to re@@ design our national accoun@@ ting system to be based upon such important things as social justice , sustain@@ ability and people &apos;s well-@@ being .
and this is a measure of how much well-@@ being we get for our plan@@ et@@ ary resource use .
they are the happ@@ i@@ est place .
and the point really is , is that i think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 20@@ 50 without an apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic something happening .
why is it , on the radio news every ev@@ ening , i hear the f@@ t@@ se 100 , the do@@ w j@@ ones , the dollar pound rati@@ o -- i don &apos;t even know which way the dollar pound rati@@ o should go to be good news .
how aware are you of things going on around the world , the seas@@ ons changing , people around you ?
and not only that , we need to create a great transition to get there , and we need to p@@ ave that great transition with good things .
my parents had this whole el@@ abor@@ ate story about s@@ anta cl@@ au@@ s : how they had talked to s@@ anta cl@@ au@@ s himself and agre@@ ed that instead of s@@ anta deli@@ vering our presents over the night of christ@@ mas eve , like he did for every other family who got to open their sur@@ prises first thing christ@@ mas morning , our family would give s@@ anta more time . s@@ anta would come to our house while we were at nine o &apos;@@ clock high mass on christ@@ mas morning , but only if all of us kids did not make a fus@@ s . which made me very susp@@ icious .
the vir@@ go pos@@ ter is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair , sort of l@@ oun@@ ging by some water , but the libr@@ a pos@@ ter is just a huge scale .
now , appar@@ ently in jer@@ us@@ al@@ em in 600 bc , everyone was completely bad and evil . every single one of them : man , woman , child , inf@@ ant , f@@ et@@ us .
women &apos;s longer lif@@ esp@@ an ? the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men ? but , no , it wasn &apos;t any of these gi@@ f@@ ts .
&lt; transcript &gt;
i needed something that would pull me out of all this .
dur@@ ga , res@@ pl@@ end@@ ent , be@@ dec@@ ked , beautiful , her 18 arms ready for war@@ f@@ are , as she ro@@ de as@@ tri@@ de her li@@ on into the batt@@ le@@ field to destro@@ y ma@@ his@@ ha@@ sur .
it &apos;s actually almost 20 years ago when i wanted to re@@ frame the way we use information , the way we work together : i invented the world wide web .
but then -- ok , when ted started , there was no web so things like &quot; click &quot; didn &apos;t have the same meaning .
what do you mean , &quot; data &quot; ? what &apos;s the difference -- documents , data ?
we &apos;re using them for people , we &apos;re using them for places , we &apos;re using them for your products , we &apos;re using them for events .
and if you actually go and look up ber@@ lin , you &apos;ll find that there are other blo@@ bs of data which also have stuff about ber@@ lin , and they &apos;re linked together .
we want the data .
now , they are sti@@ cking it onto -- linked data -- and now they can ask the sort of question , that you probably wouldn &apos;t ask , i wouldn &apos;t ask -- they would .
before i came down here , i looked it up on op@@ en@@ stre@@ et@@ map
ok , so it &apos;s called linked data .
then i started to think about the people in the him@@ al@@ ay@@ as whose cat@@ ar@@ acts would be helped , and i realized that i went from this kind of n@@ arc@@ iss@@ istic self-@@ focus to al@@ tru@@ istic joy , to feeling good for the people that were being helped . i think that &apos;s a motiv@@ ator .
and in a sense , i &apos;ve been refl@@ ecting on turning that part of us off .
this guy was back on his feet immediately .
for her , life had dis@@ til@@ led itself into one task : the es@@ cape of her family and a new life in austr@@ alia .
my mother was ex@@ hau@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and list@@ ened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
and the more candi@@ dly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and pro@@ sec@@ u@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
jam@@ ie dru@@ m@@ mon@@ d : let &apos;s crow@@ d@@ source the world &apos;s goals
what do you want ?
this is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy , where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid prom@@ ises and vague stuff up at the top really deli@@ vers for people at a gr@@ ass@@ roots level and in@@ verts that pyram@@ id .
i mean , it d@@ war@@ fs , d@@ war@@ fs everything that is actually on our news ag@@ enda , and it &apos;s invisible .
i was very gl@@ ad to see gol@@ die ha@@ wn , because i had an apo@@ logy to make to her .
and i think if you start a business without financial bac@@ king , you &apos;re likely to go the wrong side of that divi@@ ding line .
but obviously , there wasn &apos;t a lot i could do about it .
rb : i know , i have -- the law@@ yers say you mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t do things like that , but -- ca : i mean , speaking of which , tell us about -- rb : &quot; p@@ am@@ my &quot; we launched , you know -- mis@@ ta@@ ken@@ ly thought we could take on coca@@ -@@ co@@ la , and we launched a co@@ la bottle called &quot; the p@@ am@@ my &quot; and it was shaped a bit like p@@ am@@ ela anderson .
but he &apos;s an absolute geni@@ us when it comes to design .
but , anyway , we managed to survive it .
rb : i was dy@@ sl@@ ex@@ ic . i had no understanding of scho@@ ol@@ work what@@ so@@ ever .
ca : but is there a risk here ?
and he said he &apos;d be deli@@ gh@@ ted . and i said -- and he said , &quot; would you like me to wear my dog col@@ lar ? &quot;
rb : capit@@ alism has been pro@@ ven to be a system that works .
but we &apos;re also trying to make them self-@@ sustain@@ ing clin@@ ics , so that people pay for some other aspects .

i think you should study in a school of art .
because of the fo@@ cal length of the l@@ ens , it just shows what is on the other side .
and context , what is really context ?
i couldn &apos;t find it .
and if they say they don &apos;t get it , that &apos;s also not true , because it &apos;s in the air .
the same thing in the dar@@ k@@ room .
this is from the show called &quot; invisible , &quot; at tal@@ war gall@@ ery .
i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow , one kind of flow of people , one kind of flow of capital , and , of course , trade in products and services .
let me share with you the results of a surve@@ y that harvard business re@@ view was kind enough to run of its read@@ er@@ ship as to what people &apos;s gu@@ esses along these dimensions actually were .
so try this out with your friends and acqu@@ a@@ int@@ ances ,
maybe realiz@@ ing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the super@@ he@@ ated rh@@ et@@ or@@ ic that we see around the im@@ migr@@ ation issue .
so i developed a whole range around -- mass@@ -@@ produced range -- that obviously f@@ it@@ ted into a much high@@ er-@@ end dec@@ or market that could be ex@@ ported and also service our local market .
we &apos;ll start with something very simple -- newton &apos;s law : &quot; the force equ@@ als mass times acceler@@ ation . &quot; this is something that perhaps tur@@ k@@ ish air@@ lines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign .
lu@@ ck@@ ily , with now better point@@ -@@ of@@ -@@ sale trac@@ king , more digital media consumption , you can measure more what consum@@ ers actually do , rather than what they say they do .
the same is true of marketing .
i see you &apos;re all up on the history of hur@@ dy@@ -@@ gu@@ r@@ dy -- &quot; vi@@ elle à rou@@ e . &quot; and in sp@@ an@@ ish , &quot; zan@@ fon@@ a . &quot;
&lt; / transcript &gt;
their car is different from every other car in the parking lot .
when i put these people in the machine , before i put them in the m@@ ri machine , i would ask them all kinds of questions .
they have son@@ gs , po@@ ems , nov@@ els , sculp@@ tures , paint@@ ings , my@@ ths , leg@@ ends .
and , indeed , that car@@ av@@ an is moving on .
one of them is women &apos;s ver@@ bal ability . women can talk .
when the -- and there &apos;s also many more male idi@@ ots in the world .
they &apos;re now saying that in america , that middle age should be regard@@ ed as up to age 85 . because in that highest age categ@@ ory of 7@@ 6 to 85 , as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them .
so i want to conclu@@ de with two things . i want to conclu@@ de with a worry -- i have a worry -- and with a wonderful story .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot;
an hour later they get down off of the ri@@ ck@@ sha@@ w , and she thro@@ ws her hands up and she says , &quot; wasn &apos;t that wonderful ? &quot;
this is 5@@ 9 seconds into the film .
interes@@ t@@ ingly , the nur@@ ses themselves , sort of , sn@@ apped into action -- said , ok , we embr@@ ace this . what can we do ?
we were asked by a device produc@@ er -- we did the pal@@ m pil@@ ot and the tre@@ o .
why do we w@@ ra@@ p the te@@ ab@@ a@@ g string around the cu@@ p hand@@ le ?
but big selling bo@@ ok@@ case . how do we repli@@ cate this for children ?
we had to completely trans@@ fer ourselves over to their world .
how far you can antici@@ p@@ ate , what fol@@ lows from it , what are the thre@@ ats , what are the possibilities , the challenges , the opportunities ?
and there are some of those quali@@ ties in this drawing , which see@@ ks to sum up the re@@ comm@@ end@@ ations .
for example , if you take , and you make a compar@@ is@@ on between a recent kind of city , what i &apos;ll call , simpli@@ sti@@ cally , a north american city -- and de@@ tro@@ it is not a bad example , it is very car depend@@ ent .
and here , the first thing you can see is that this building , the roof is a very warm kind of over@@ co@@ at blan@@ k@@ et , a kind of insul@@ ating garden , which is also about the celebr@@ ation of public space .
the library of the free university , which opened last year , is an example of that .
and the turning point was probably , in our terms , when we had the first computer .
a combination of biom@@ ass , a@@ qui@@ f@@ ers , burning veget@@ able oil -- a process that , quite interes@@ t@@ ingly , was developed in eastern ger@@ many , at the time of its depend@@ ence on the sovi@@ et blo@@ c .
and the base of the building is again about public space .
hu@@ bert was saying , absolutely correc@@ tly , &quot; these are the new ca@@ the@@ dr@@ als . &quot;
so , in the next eight minutes i would like to share with you my story .
as you can see in this national ben@@ ch@@ mar@@ king ass@@ ess@@ ment taken by over 2,000 schools in india , ri@@ ver@@ side children were out@@ per@@ forming the top 10 schools in india in math , english and science .
so , you &apos;re getting the pattern . first 200 children at ri@@ ver@@ side .
k@@ bs : girls and boys in hy@@ der@@ ab@@ ad , going out , pretty difficult , but they did it .
an@@ il gu@@ p@@ ta is on the hun@@ t for the developing world &apos;s un@@ sun@@ g invent@@ ors -- indi@@ gen@@ ous entrepreneurs whose in@@ gen@@ u@@ ity , hidden by poverty , could change many people &apos;s lives . he shows how the hon@@ ey be@@ e network helps them build the connections they need -- and gain the recogni@@ tion they des@@ erve .
so what kind of a contribu@@ tor was i ?
it must be the same .
the rice that you ate in the lunch , and you will eat today , is trans@@ plan@@ ted by women b@@ ending in a very aw@@ k@@ ward pos@@ ture ,
and it all begins with curios@@ ity .
obviously she &apos;s an artist ; she &apos;s a creative person .
and a new business model can emer@@ ge .
higher the local fit , greater is the chance of scal@@ ing up .
new inv@@ entions are the passion of my life .
this innovation is from the slu@@ ms of ri@@ o .
now , this lady , she used to do the win@@ ding of the y@@ ar@@ n for po@@ champ@@ ally s@@ are@@ e .
and i think that is the qu@@ int@@ essence of this 18@@ -@@ minute talk -- that there is no good ligh@@ ting that is healthy and for our well-@@ being without pro@@ per dar@@ kness .
and it &apos;s just a bit bright up there , so these people have found a very intri@@ gu@@ ing solution .
and i see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to rela@@ x and to contem@@ plate .
and it is all about this planet .
so i asked our labor@@ atory to do something about it , and they said , &quot; well , we can do something . &quot;
and can we pres@@ erve the dar@@ kness ?
and finally i want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater .
and hen@@ ry ford , just about 100 years ago , started cr@@ an@@ king out model ts .
and i certainly wouldn &apos;t want to give up my airplane , or my hel@@ ic@@ op@@ ter , or my hum@@ ve@@ e , or my por@@ s@@ che .
in 5,000 years , we &apos;ve gone back@@ wards in getting around cities .
one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accep@@ ted , happened out here in california .
cars were not meant for par@@ alle@@ l parking ; they &apos;re wonderful machines to go between cities , but just think about it : we &apos;ve solved all the long-@@ range , high-@@ speed problems .
depend@@ ing on whose numbers you believe , it &apos;s between 60 and 8@@ 5,000 people per day .
we have to plan issues many months in adv@@ ance ; we have to guess at what public ap@@ petites are going to be six months , nine months down the road . so we &apos;re in the fore@@ ca@@ sting business .
the first is the critical price .
there &apos;s a company called ap@@ ex , a no@@ -@@ name chinese fir@@ m , who has , several times in the past year , been the num@@ ber@@ -@@ one d@@ v@@ d sel@@ ler in america . their average price , for last year , was 4@@ 8 dollars .
if you look here , here &apos;s lin@@ u@@ x in red , and it &apos;s hit 20 percent . interes@@ t@@ ingly , it &apos;s done a cro@@ s@@ so@@ ver before , but not the cro@@ s@@ so@@ vers that matter .
it &apos;s an economic force ; it &apos;s a technical force .
&lt; transcript &gt;
even more probl@@ em@@ atic , they &apos;re not listening to poor people themselves .
and it could transform s@@ wa@@ ths of desert land into fields of emer@@ ald green .
we &apos;re starting to see these happening all around the world .
edu@@ ca@@ tional initi@@ atives like di@@ l and the citiz@@ en foundation that are building schools across the country .
and he said , &quot; of course i will .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
during the hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e , you had m@@ sn@@ bc pos@@ ting about the hur@@ ri@@ can@@ e on their blog , up@@ d@@ ating it frequ@@ ently . this was possible because of the easy nature of blog@@ ging tools .
i like music , and i like ban@@ jo@@ s , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing ,
but any@@ ways .
and today he is a healthy baby , who , if you read his blog -- it &apos;s s@@ no@@ w@@ de@@ al@@ .@@ or@@ g , his father &apos;s blog -- he is taking pictures of him still , because he is still his son and he is , i think , at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital .
so , that has always influ@@ enced me .
i was sick , and i was in a hotel room , and i wanted not to be there . and so you see these things .
i &apos;ve been fascin@@ ated for a lifetime by the beauty , form and function of giant blu@@ e@@ fin tun@@ a .
the result is whether you &apos;re looking at the west or the eastern blu@@ e@@ fin population , there &apos;s been tremendous decline on both sides , as much as 90 percent if you go back with your bas@@ el@@ ine to 19@@ 50 .
and for the first time , we &apos;re able to watch the journey of a tun@@ a bene@@ ath the ocean using light and phot@@ ons to measure sun@@ rise and sun@@ set .
so in a program called tag@@ -@@ a-@@ giant we &apos;ve actually gone from i@@ rel@@ and to canada , from cor@@ si@@ ca to sp@@ ain .
there are two villages , h@@ arr@@ is and mo@@ re@@ head city , every winter for over a decade , held a party called tag@@ -@@ a-@@ giant , and together , f@@ ish@@ ers worked with us to tag 800 to 9@@ 00 fish .
this model , a model of over@@ la@@ p , is the way to move forward .
and now , together , what we can see on this ocean of color that &apos;s temperature , we can see ten@@ -@@ day wor@@ ms of ma@@ k@@ os and sal@@ mon sharks .
they &apos;re taking information from our planet at very critical places like ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca and the po@@ les .
we can save the white shark .
&quot; where were you the 1@@ 1@@ th ? &quot; &quot; where were you the 10@@ th ? &quot; &quot; where were you the 2@@ 9@@ th ? the 3@@ 0@@ th ? &quot; &quot; where were you octo@@ ber 5@@ th ? &quot; we read about six months of my cal@@ end@@ ar .
so at the end of six months of this and nine con@@ sec@@ uti@@ ve poly@@ graph@@ s , they said , &quot; hey , everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
so you can see , del@@ ta 1@@ 2@@ 5@@ 2 going from k@@ ans@@ as city to at@@ l@@ anta .
sometimes there &apos;s a lot of information .
at 11 : 3@@ 9 a.@@ m. was this one .
but if 300 million people in the u.s. started doing this , we would have to re@@ design the entire intelligence system from the ground up .
and i &apos;m gl@@ ad that we have pa@@ trons of the arts in these fields .
what &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can compare societies , more and less equal societies , and see what ine@@ quality does .
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
here , for instance , is trust .
there &apos;s a about a ten@@ fold difference there , lo@@ g scale up the side .
so what we &apos;re looking at is general social dis@@ function related to ine@@ quality .
you see there that swe@@ den does better than britain all the way across the social hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y .
there are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equ@@ ality in the academ@@ ic pe@@ er-@@ re@@ vie@@ wed journ@@ als .
he had a vision . when he got out , he was going to leave the d@@ ope game for good and fly straight , and he was actually working on mer@@ ging his two pas@@ sions into one vision .
you want a dir@@ ty magazine ?
and i haven &apos;t the sli@@ gh@@ test idea of what it does or what it &apos;s good for , but i want it .
yeah ! yeah .
so , imagine i have a plan@@ k about two feet wide and 30 feet long
so to get work done , you &apos;ve got to set a dea@@ d@@ line , right ?
most of what we do is sub@@ conscious .
and the third level is refl@@ ective , which is , if you like the super@@ e@@ go , it &apos;s a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do , no control over the -- doesn &apos;t see the sen@@ ses , doesn &apos;t control the muscles .
i &apos;m only saying positive things from now on .
that seemed a little dam@@ ning , and i tried to cor@@ relate it with things like infrastructure , or with the avail@@ ability of electricity , and things like that .
so , you know , it puts the teacher into a tough b@@ ind , you have to think .
very quickly , he noticed that when he moves his finger on the tou@@ ch@@ pad something moves on the screen -- and later on he told me , &quot; i have never seen a television where you can do something . &quot;
so they said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve left this machine which talks only in english , so we had to learn english . &quot;
but we got a clean learning curve , almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school .
and asked them -- i gave them about 6@@ 8 different valu@@ es-@@ orient@@ ed questions and simply asked them their opin@@ ions .
i think it &apos;s time that the edu@@ ca@@ tion@@ ists made their own spec@@ s , and i have such a set of spec@@ s . this is a bri@@ ef look at that .
and i did the tests in the roy@@ al air force to become a pil@@ ot , and sure enough , i failed .
and that was exciting -- that was fun .
it was nice .
but , in a way , i &apos;ve got used to the sensation of it .
there was this whole f@@ ancy diplom@@ atic system , this negoti@@ ation process about the future of ko@@ so@@ v@@ o , and the ko@@ so@@ v@@ ars weren &apos;t part of it .
we &apos;re ad@@ vis@@ ing various island states in the climate change negoti@@ ations , which is suppose to cul@@ min@@ ate in cop@@ enh@@ ag@@ en .
they may be corpor@@ ations , they may be ma@@ fi@@ o@@ si , they may be nice n@@ gos , they may anything , any number of things .
this is terrible that you don &apos;t con@@ sul@@ t these people who are actually affected .
that is the politics of the 21@@ st century ,
the real bacteria and viruses are so small we can &apos;t see them without a microscope , and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick .
instead , it sil@@ ently sli@@ ps into the bacteria &apos;s own dna , and it just st@@ ays there like a terror@@ ist sle@@ e@@ per cell , waiting for instructions .
if we want to sum@@ mar@@ ize that story that i told you earlier , we could start by saying something like , &quot; these viruses make cop@@ ies of themselves by sli@@ pping their dna into a bacter@@ ium . &quot;
but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across .
lau@@ ren z@@ al@@ az@@ nic@@ k : the conscience of television
as humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temp@@ er , or ta@@ me , these basic animal instinc@@ ts .
so i really hope our global audi@@ ences can relate .
social comment@@ ary is all of a sudden spi@@ king up .
this is a quick char@@ t . here &apos;s another attribu@@ te : fantas@@ y and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday re@@ al@@ m &quot; and &quot; makes me feel better . &quot;
what do people want in their tv then ?
jon@@ athan hai@@ d@@ t : religion , evolution , and the ec@@ st@@ as@@ y of self-@@ trans@@ cend@@ ence
stephen br@@ ad@@ ley : i thought i saw the sav@@ ior in human shape for about one second in the room , with arms ext@@ ended , appear@@ ing to say to me , &quot; come . &quot;
i believe that it is nothing less than the assur@@ ance of im@@ mortality that makes self-@@ sacri@@ fice at these moments so relatively easy .
so here &apos;s the milli@@ on-@@ dollar question for social scientists like me : is the st@@ air@@ case a fe@@ ature of our evolutionary design ?
and once you put these guys in a boat comp@@ eting with another boat , now they &apos;ve got no choice but to co@@ operate because they &apos;re all in the same boat .
and now let &apos;s r@@ er@@ un the simulation putting one of these super@@ organisms into a population of fre@@ e-@@ ri@@ ders , of def@@ ect@@ ors , of che@@ at@@ ers and look what happens .
one of the most common is clim@@ bing the secret st@@ air@@ case and losing ourselves .
i see this desire in my students at the university of virgin@@ ia .
as i was building this space , i thought to myself , &quot; su@@ rely i &apos;m not the only guy to have to have car@@ ved out a space for his own . &quot;
this is in long island , new york .
and so they created these spaces to refl@@ ect what they love to do , and who they were .
take a look at the second door and see if there &apos;s any different message .
so , this is from &quot; 2@@ n@@ d sight , &quot; a book i did on intuition .
so , a couple sp@@ re@@ ads from the book : here m@@ clu@@ h@@ an says , &quot; the new media are not bri@@ d@@ ges between man and nature ; they are nature . &quot;
got no way of trac@@ king it , so i could be totally wrong .
you know : thank god it &apos;s mon@@ day -- i get to go back to that little cu@@ bic@@ le , those fa@@ ke gray walls , and hear everybody else &apos;s conversations f or 10 hours and then go home .
and i was basically pretty dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ed to see that they had cho@@ sen to show the photo we &apos;d already seen a million times , which was basically the moment of impact .
i &apos;m not sure this is an impro@@ vement , or a good idea , because , like , if you don &apos;t spend quite enough time in front of your computer , you can now get a plate in the ke@@ y@@ board , so there &apos;s no more fa@@ king it -- that you don &apos;t really sit at your des@@ k all day and eat and work anyway . now there &apos;s a plate , and it would be really , really conven@@ ient to get a piece of pi@@ zz@@ a , then type a little bit , then ...
why not experiment ? why not have some fun ?
before that , obviously , technology didn &apos;t exist . but obviously it did .
crai@@ g v@@ enter &apos;s tremendous and brilliant attempt to dna sequence things in the ocean is great .
and wher@@ ever life is , it never re@@ tre@@ ats . it &apos;s u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous and it wants to be more .
and thir@@ dly , the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cli@@ che . and i &apos;m happy to say , i was part@@ ly responsible for that cli@@ che that machines are becoming biological , but that &apos;s pretty evid@@ ent .
all of them are still being produced . so you &apos;ve got corn sh@@ ell@@ ers .
the orig@@ ins of technology was not in 18@@ 29 , but was actually at the beginning of the big bang , and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compr@@ essed . the entire universe was compr@@ essed into a little quantum do@@ t , and it was so ti@@ ght in there , there was no room for any difference at all .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
and i reach@@ ed down and picked him up , and immediately became fascin@@ ated and im@@ pressed by its speed and its strength and ag@@ ilit@@ y .
then he lif@@ ts another arm and i lif@@ t an arm .
and after the first week , they igno@@ red us .
and as you go dee@@ per , that lo@@ vely , blue water you were launched in gives way to dar@@ ker and dar@@ ker blue .
and it completely thre@@ w science on its head .
so this rain@@ water is f@@ loo@@ ding down the h@@ ill@@ side , carrying with it se@@ di@@ ments from the construction site , smo@@ ther@@ ing the coral and killing it .
and fix it .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and the primary poli@@ c@@ em@@ en are women , because we are the car@@ ri@@ ers of the tradition .
and then i thought -- in my 4@@ 0s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
and the tsunami of problems that we feel we &apos;re facing in terms of sustain@@ ability questions are actually a refl@@ ection of the exponenti@@ al increase in urban@@ ization across the planet .
so here &apos;s two questions that i have in my head when i think about this problem .
that &apos;s called growth . here &apos;s how you grew .
it &apos;s particularly aston@@ ishing because each one of these organisms , each sub@@ system , each cell type , each gene , has evolved in its own unique environmental ni@@ che with its own unique history .
is new york a scal@@ ed up san francisco , which is a scal@@ ed up s@@ anta fe ?
here it is , which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capit@@ a , unlike biology -- higher w@@ ages , more super-@@ creative people per capit@@ a as you get bigger , more pat@@ ents per capit@@ a , more crime per capit@@ a .
on the left is the heart rate showing biology .
this happens to be income and ass@@ ets versus the size of the company as den@@ ot@@ ed by its number of employees .
in 19@@ 3@@ 1 , my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- gradu@@ ated from the ei@@ gh@@ th grade .
and i believed it ,
but they were into it . and i asked them to put their own voice over it .
and the student that pers@@ ist@@ ently turns out the best visual product did not dis@@ ap@@ point .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
re@@ gener@@ ative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about re@@ gener@@ ative medicine not too long ago .
4@@ 1 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one reti@@ ree who was experi@@ encing de@@ bilit@@ ating disease .
this video , i think , gets across the concept that i &apos;m talking about quite dra@@ ma@@ tically .
and there are certain tools in our to@@ ol@@ box that allow us to do this today .
this is an older lady . she has cancer of the li@@ ver as well as diab@@ et@@ es , and has decided to die with what &apos; s left of her body int@@ act .
you can see here a little bit of heart muscle be@@ ating in a dish .
this is the same proce@@ dure , but now done minim@@ ally inv@@ asi@@ vely , with only three holes in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply inj@@ ecting stem cells through a la@@ paro@@ scop@@ ic proce@@ dure .
the g@@ un that you see there spr@@ ays cells .
but there &apos;s been no strate@@ gi@@ c investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a car@@ eful way .
how do we self-@@ identify and how mu@@ table is that identity ?
not only , of course , the scientists and all the wonderful gi@@ ants of the industries but the cel@@ e@@ bri@@ ties .
you know , when you &apos;re standing up here , you can see all the different people .
my name is nor@@ ai@@ da . and i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m so thr@@ illed to be part of like your ted conference that you &apos;re doing and everything like that .
you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything .
and it was ma@@ dame bou@@ s@@ son , you know , she was very &#91; french &#93; .
and , sad@@ ly , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll have time for you to meet everybody i brought , but -- i &apos;m trying to be@@ have myself ,
she only wants to spend time with her friends .
it is not harvard .
i just -- thank you .
so , when these kind of people -- and , believe me , it &apos;s not just the police that use these tax@@ is in l@@ agos . we all do . i &apos;ve been on one of these , and i didn &apos;t have a hel@@ met , either .
it &apos;s been tap@@ ed with tape that we even stopped using in the u.@@ k .
i got him to come with me -- an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia tech -- come with me from the u.@@ k .
the oxygen tan@@ ks didn &apos;t quite work right .
decide which instruments , stoc@@ k it up with consu@@ ma@@ bles . and currently we &apos;re working on oxygen -- oxygen deli@@ very on-@@ site .
but i found that there were some adv@@ antages to being in hollywood .
i then had a bit of a wa@@ ke@@ -up call when i was 14 .
bet on good people doing good things . &quot;
and i thought about the films that inspired me , films like &quot; gand@@ hi &quot; and &quot; sch@@ ind@@ ler &apos;s list . &quot;
speaking of which , our fellow ted@@ ster , al -- i first saw al do his slide show presentation on global warming in may of 2005 .
and a document@@ ary that we &apos;re doing on j@@ im@@ my car@@ ter and his mi@@ d-@@ east peace efforts over the years .
the next day , all the artists were invited to join mandel@@ a in rob@@ ben island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
it &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
now that is pre@@ vention at the very beginning of life .
i think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
in a pre-@@ internet world , so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty over our physical free@@ dom@@ s , or lack there@@ of , was controlled almost entirely by nation@@ -@@ states .
this is a map of social networks worldwide , and certainly facebook has con@@ qu@@ ered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing , depend@@ ing on how you like the way facebook man@@ ages its service .
we don &apos;t necessarily always do it very well , but we have a sense of what the models are , poli@@ tically and institu@@ tion@@ ally , to do that .
these are gri@@ m economic times , fellow ted@@ sters , gri@@ m economic times indeed .
and am@@ ong@@ st the chaos , am@@ id@@ st the eu@@ ph@@ or@@ ia , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wi@@ el@@ ded power before 198@@ 9 , in eastern europe , continu@@ ed to do so after the re@@ volu@@ tions there .
and so i resol@@ ved to travel around the world examin@@ ing this global crimin@@ al under@@ world by talking to poli@@ c@@ em@@ en , by talking to vic@@ ti@@ ms , by talking to consum@@ ers of illi@@ c@@ it goods and services .
the con@@ gol@@ ese war lor@@ ds were selling this stuff to the ma@@ fi@@ a in exchange for weapons ,
and boy , did that make it easy for the money laun@@ der@@ ers .
there has , however , been no con@@ com@@ it@@ ant increase in the resources available to police forces .
and it &apos;s actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cyber@@ crime is that it &apos;s not so much the technology .
there is no rom@@ ance involved with gang@@ sters in the 21@@ st century .
i quickly made an arrang@@ ement with a red cross reli@@ ef wor@@ ker , who used his offici@@ al van to transport the money to lun@@ g@@ i air@@ port , fre@@ et@@ own , although he did not know the real cont@@ ents of the box .
ze frank : oh . amazing .
voice : we want mal@@ col@@ m gl@@ ad@@ well .
i won &apos;t -- hold on . making things , you know --
i mean this is incredible . this is an 1@@ 1@@ -year-old girl -- dre@@ w this
and all over the world , em@@ in@@ ent evoluti@@ on@@ ists are anxi@@ ous to celebr@@ ate this .
the pal@@ e@@ on@@ to@@ logists themselves looked a bit more clo@@ sely at the ac@@ compan@@ ying micro@@ fau@@ na that lived in the same time and place as the hom@@ in@@ ids .
that &apos;s why you don &apos;t hear them talking about it . it &apos;s yesterday &apos;s question .
pe@@ als of mer@@ ry lau@@ ghter !
we have got skin lin@@ ed with this layer .
i ask people sometimes , and they say , &quot; i like the aqu@@ atic theory !
har@@ dy &apos;s ideas and darwin &apos;s ideas will be bl@@ ended together .
and secon@@ dly , he says , &quot; you must never be afraid to rock the boat . &quot;
and so i was thinking about how it might be great if i could just take all these no@@ ises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if i could just physi@@ cally extr@@ ic@@ ate them and pull them out in such a form that i could share them with somebody else .
and so when i was first living in new york city a few years back , i was thinking a lot about the familiar architec@@ tural forms that surr@@ ounded me and how i would like to better relate to them .
and i was really stru@@ ck by how much it affected me .
the second one -- unlike most animals , which is survival of the species -- this is pres@@ er@@ vation of self .
second of all , i &apos;m going to re@@ comm@@ end that you get into a pro@@ active st@@ ance and write to your el@@ ected offici@@ als at least once a month .
because this estab@@ li@@ sh@@ es the two primary cr@@ it@@ eri@@ a for the political creature : that you have influence in a large sphere , and that my pres@@ er@@ vation depends on you .
this is where we &apos;re hea@@ ded in terms of global temperature ris@@ es , and if we keep on going the way we &apos;re going , we get a four@@ - or fi@@ ve-@@ degre@@ e-@@ centi@@ grade temperature rise by the end of this century .
what &apos;s wrong with you people on the other side in the other party ?
we love to circle around things . we circle around fl@@ ag@@ s , and then we can trust each other .
and what they do on that surve@@ y is they ask what &apos;s called a feeling ther@@ mom@@ eter r@@ ating .
so open prim@@ aries would make that problem much , much less sev@@ ere .
so here &apos;s another astero@@ id .
they ear@@ n a lot of money , they invest that money in their kids , some of them become ti@@ ger mothers , the kids rise to their full potential , and the kids go on to become the top two lines in this graph .
for example , the incar@@ cer@@ ation rate , the prison population in this country has qu@@ ad@@ ru@@ pl@@ ed since 19@@ 80 .
and this is the con@@ version of one group of subst@@ ances into another , either through the production or the absor@@ ption of energy .
and that &apos;s the sh@@ ell around that glo@@ bu@@ lar fat .
we &apos;re looking at cr@@ y@@ st@@ al lat@@ ti@@ ces to see the bon@@ ding process in this .
se@@ bas@@ tian thr@@ un helped build google &apos;s amazing dri@@ ver@@ less car , powered by a very personal qu@@ est to save lives and reduce traffic accidents . j@@ aw@@ dro@@ pping video shows the dar@@ pa chall@@ en@@ ge@@ -@@ win@@ ning car mot@@ or@@ ing through bu@@ sy city traffic with no one behind the whe@@ el , and dra@@ matic test drive foot@@ age from ted@@ 20@@ 11 demonstr@@ ates how fast the thing can really go .
mountain roads , day and night , and even cro@@ o@@ ked l@@ omb@@ ard street in san francisco .
on this map , the colo@@ red areas represent water conflic@@ ts .
it &apos;s a broken system . there &apos;s a dis@@ incenti@@ ve to con@@ serve , because , if you don &apos;t use your water right , you can lose your water right .
you &apos;ve got a dis@@ incenti@@ ve to con@@ serve , because if you don &apos;t use your water right , you risk losing your water right .
we &apos;ve re@@ turned more than four billion g@@ allons of water to de@@ grad@@ ed eco@@ systems .
compassion is fun .
and let me give you some examples .
so what has this got to do with business leadership ?
that &apos;s one .
the third step , following the second step , is to create new mental hab@@ its .
we often think of tor@@ ture as being political tor@@ ture or reser@@ ved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of tor@@ ture today is not for political pris@@ on@@ ers .
and when i walked up to the prison director , i said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to let her out .
but the third and most important thing is that we make a commit@@ ment to this .
those of us who believe in heav@@ en have some sort of idea of what heav@@ en would be .
and at mom@@ a we put out some books just for people to suggest their own hum@@ ble ma@@ ster@@ pieces .
design can be that , of course , but it can also be this .
and at the same time , the gor@@ ge@@ ous work of ta@@ k@@ es@@ hi is@@ hi@@ gu@@ ro , who did these beautiful sal@@ t-@@ and-@@ pep@@ per con@@ tain@@ ers that are made of rice d@@ ough .
so , designers do need to be m@@ av@@ eric@@ ks ,
i don &apos;t think it ever happened before at mom@@ a ;
sometimes ham@@ mer@@ -@@ on .
and this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin ,
a typical disaster story : disease , corruption , poverty . and some of you might be standing here thinking , saying , &quot; ok , you know , ory , you &apos;re harv@@ ar@@ d-@@ educ@@ ated , and all you privil@@ eg@@ ed people come here , saying , &apos; forget the poor people . let &apos;s focus on business and the markets , and whatever . &apos; &quot;
and my father said , &quot; ok , listen . let &apos;s go and try and talk to the head@@ mis@@ tr@@ ess .
and that kept him going .
so we need to start getting better .
one is because i &apos;m pretty ag@@ gr@@ essive , and i try and find , you know , opportunities .
my@@ sh@@ k@@ in ing@@ aw@@ ale : a blood test without ble@@ eding

one of the things which my inter@@ n here , pr@@ at@@ esh , built is a mobile application , which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go .
none of the glamour that you see today exis@@ ted .
the average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years .
this is the best technology that this region could ever have : des@@ al@@ in@@ ation .
so we know very well -- i showed you earlier -- that we need this energy .
i wo@@ ke up the morning after i gave that talk with the worst vulner@@ ability han@@ go@@ ver of my life .
the first is vulner@@ ability is not wea@@ kness .
about three months ago , i was in a s@@ porting goods store buying go@@ gg@@ les and sh@@ in gu@@ ards and all the things that parents buy at the s@@ porting goods store .
we heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery , which is have a chec@@ k@@ list .
but when he &apos;s in the ar@@ ena , at best he w@@ ins , and at worst he lo@@ ses , but when he fai@@ ls , when he lo@@ ses , he does so dar@@ ing great@@ ly . &quot;
it &apos;s un@@ comfortable , but it &apos;s adap@@ tive .
shame is an epidemic in our culture .
it is a dream of man@@ kind to fly like a bird .
so if you go down , you have the large area of propul@@ sion ,
woman : everywhere i went looking for work , they said no , what use do we have for a blind woman ?
when we grow in spiritu@@ al consciousness , we identify ourselves with all that is in the world , so there is no explo@@ itation .
we did a study , a scienti@@ fically designed process , and then , to our dis@@ may , we found this was only reach@@ ing seven percent of those in need , and we &apos;re not a@@ de@@ quat@@ ely ad@@ dr@@ essing more , bigger problems .
so the final part of the puzzle is , how do you make all this work financi@@ ally , especially when the people can &apos;t pay for it ?
maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in produc@@ tivity , maybe in efficiency , in the clinical process , or in how much they pay for the len@@ ses or consu@@ ma@@ bles , or regul@@ ations , their defen@@ sive practice .
that &apos;s my question .
again , it &apos;s a mobile ph@@ one-@@ shaped box ,
very exciting .
a part of me had become ali@@ en@@ ated from myself .
because of what i &apos;m about to say , i really should estab@@ lish my green cre@@ denti@@ als .
the ag@@ gre@@ gate numbers are absolutely overwhel@@ ming :
social capital in the slu@@ ms is at its most urban and dense .
it &apos;s not supposed to be there , but it &apos;s huge .
so the event is : we &apos;re a city planet . that just happened .
and there &apos;s not enough carrying capacity to support the people . and then you &apos;re in trouble .
it &apos;s supposed to be , i don &apos;t know , local solar and wind and co@@ generation , and good things like that .
they reduce p@@ esti@@ cide use .
that would be considered an act of war by both nations .
this is the boat we were on , by the way .
on the question of , &quot; what if the i@@ pc scientists are all wrong ? &quot;
now this is actually a popular pla@@ que , and this is a crowd of over@@ achiev@@ ers , so i &apos;m bet@@ ting that some of you have this pla@@ que .
in other words , the ocean is big ; she can take it .

richard w@@ ur@@ man : can i say something ?
dh : one more , one more .
bf : this guy , this guy invented air .
dh : and turn up the inten@@ sity ; we &apos;re still pin@@ k in the middle .

so i &apos;m thinking , you know , this proce@@ dure hasn &apos;t changed in about 40 years .
adult stem cells are throughout our body , including the b@@ loo@@ d-@@ forming stem cells in our bone mar@@ row ,
so it &apos;s really quite big .

any particles more massive than this energy lim@@ it aren &apos;t produced , and rem@@ ain invisible to us .
now , if we count up all these different particles using their various sp@@ ins and charges , there are 2@@ 26 .
nature always keeps a perfect balance .
this is the way the@@ ories of uni@@ fication work .
this e@@ 8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots .
now , the only way to maint@@ ain san@@ ity and achieve happiness in the mid@@ st of this un@@ certa@@ int@@ y is to keep balance and perspective in life .
and that shape has remarkable simil@@ ari@@ ties -- and the way it fits into this e@@ 8 pattern could be the rest of the picture .
so i &apos;ll be talking about the success of my camp@@ us , the university of mar@@ y@@ land , bal@@ ti@@ more coun@@ ty , um@@ bc , in educ@@ ating students of all types , across the arts and hu@@ mani@@ ties and the science and engineering areas . what makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academ@@ ic lad@@ der -- students of color , students under@@ represent@@ ed in sel@@ ected areas .
i wanted to know that the school i attend@@ ed not only had good teachers , but the resources we needed .
and the question is this : how is it that now we lead the country in producing afri@@ can@@ -@@ americans who go on to complete ph@@ .@@ d@@ . &apos; s in science and engineering and m@@ .@@ d@@ . / ph@@ .@@ d@@ . &apos; s ?
i don &apos;t care how smart you are or how smart you think you are .
students are not taught to work in groups .
and so we re@@ designed chemistry , we re@@ designed physics .
j@@ ane goo@@ d@@ all helps humans and animals live together
and we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanz@@ ees , just as it is for us , in relation to learning .
this led to a program , which we call tac@@ are .
and the other problems -- in not only africa , but the rest of the developing world and , indeed , everywhere --
and the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support , who are too poor to buy food , who can &apos;t move away because the whole land is de@@ grad@@ ed .
and then , if they &apos;re able , they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world .
it &apos;s one of my ho@@ b@@ by@@ hor@@ ses .
we could make a very long list , but obviously n@@ el@@ son mandel@@ a , emerging from 17 years of hard physical labor , 23 years of im@@ pris@@ on@@ ment , with this amazing ability to for@@ give , so that he could lead his nation out the evil regi@@ me of a@@ par@@ the@@ id without a b@@ loo@@ d@@ bat@@ h .
so we don &apos;t really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make opti@@ mal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take .
and , as he pic@@ ks up a product the system can recognize the product that he &apos;s pic@@ king up , using either image recogni@@ tion or mark@@ er technology , and give him the green light or an orange light .

those who are interested in poetry , the po@@ em is &quot; a sh@@ ro@@ p@@ sh@@ ire l@@ ad &quot; written by a.@@ e@@ . hou@@ s@@ man .
now that su@@ its the powerful up to a moment .
so there &apos;s my first message , that if you are to pass through these tur@@ bu@@ lent times more or less tur@@ bul@@ ently , then our success in doing that will in large measure de@@ pend on our capacity to bring sensible govern@@ ance to the global space .
now notice , in a period which is domin@@ ated by a mon@@ o-@@ po@@ lar world , you have fix@@ ed alli@@ ances -- na@@ to , the war@@ saw p@@ act .
how many americans ? 11 .
now the enem@@ y is inside the walls .
and so suddenly , ladies and gentlemen , what has been the proposition of visi@@ on@@ aries and po@@ ets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy .
and does purpose play into it ?
there is just too many things to go wrong .
they came up with an un@@ le@@ av@@ ened whole whe@@ at bread called car@@ ta musi@@ ca made out of du@@ ru@@ m whe@@ at , a type of che@@ ese made from gr@@ ass@@ -@@ f@@ ed animals so the che@@ ese is high in om@@ e@@ ga@@ -@@ 3 fat@@ ty aci@@ ds instead of om@@ e@@ ga@@ -@@ 6 fat@@ ty aci@@ ds from cor@@ n@@ -@@ f@@ ed animals , and a type of wine that has three times the level of poly@@ phen@@ ols than any known wine in the world .
and they eat about eight times as much to@@ f@@ u as americans do .
instead there is one word that im@@ bu@@ es your entire life , and that word is &quot; i@@ k@@ ig@@ ai . &quot;
and the difference is even more pron@@ oun@@ ced among men , who are expected to live about 11 years longer than their american counter@@ parts .
ed ra@@ w@@ l@@ ings , 10@@ 3 years old now , an active co@@ w@@ boy , starts his morning with a swim .
if they want to mix up a ca@@ ke , they &apos;re doing it by hand .
we know from the fram@@ in@@ gh@@ am studies , that if your three best friends are ob@@ ese there is a 50 percent better chance that you &apos;ll be over@@ weight .
it took us 11 years to become oper@@ ational .
and after that first par@@ abo@@ la , you know , the do@@ c said everything is great . he was sm@@ iling , and we said go .
and what i &apos;ve tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustr@@ ator -- since i was taught animation by my father , who was a sculp@@ tor and my visual ment@@ or -- i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation , by using pictures , by telling stories
they pass information to each other . they cause different things to happen inside the cell .
his death hit me pretty hard .
and when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public res@@ tro@@ om outside my van at night , i used a bu@@ cket and a tr@@ ash ba@@ g as a toil@@ et .
and when i realized that tim rus@@ sert , former moder@@ ator of &quot; meet the press , &quot; was talking about my writing , while i was living in a van in a wal@@ -@@ mar@@ t parking lot , i started laugh@@ ing .
three years ago i was living in a van in a wal@@ -@@ mar@@ t parking lot ,
we didn &apos;t take no as an answer ; we took no as a question .
so we went to the teachers .
and this is on the fourth of ju@@ ly .
so i thought , &quot; well , if you can &apos;t go to the government , go to the military . &quot;
these are primary school kids -- third , fourth grade -- going to every house@@ hold in the village , every house@@ hold in the whole of th@@ ail@@ and , giving aids information and a con@@ dom to every house@@ hold , given by these young kids .
i gave this to al gore and to bill sen@@ ior also .
so , that was done .
and then now , finally in education , we want to change the school as being under@@ utili@@ zed into a place where it &apos;s a lif@@ el@@ ong learning center for everyone .
he should be friend@@ ly and cu@@ te .
i &apos;ve always wanted a picture of a 1,@@ 5@@ 00@@ -@@ person ted audience .

the streets of tur@@ in were covered with red pos@@ ters announ@@ cing the s@@ log@@ an of the olym@@ pic@@ s .

somehow , the family survi@@ ves for 16 months , and then , by extraordinary lu@@ ck , and the passionate heart of a young american man , s@@ ash@@ a chan@@ off , who man@@ ages to put her in a u.s. res@@ cue plane ,

just like in language and other dom@@ ains , we know that it &apos;s hard for people to par@@ se very complex sent@@ ences with a kind of re@@ cur@@ sive structure .
where are these things happening in the brain ?
if they can do it in 10 seconds , they &apos;re going to actually ear@@ n that money .
your intuition might tell you that too .
they &apos;re still our clo@@ s@@ est genetic k@@ in .
his thought was , maybe they &apos;ve pres@@ er@@ ved brain acti@@ vities and they practice them in development that are really , really important to them to negoti@@ ate status and to win , which is something like strate@@ gi@@ c thinking during competition .
here &apos;s two human groups in green and blue .
and given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it &apos;s passed through an animal first , that &apos;s not a very efficient way of feeding us .
in the ancient near east , known as the ferti@@ le c@@ res@@ cent .
if we look at a map of london in the 17@@ th century , we can see that its grain , which is coming in from the th@@ am@@ es , along the bottom of this map .
and if we look at an image of s@@ mi@@ th@@ field in 18@@ 30 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be un@@ aware of where your food came from .
we used to co@@ ok ; now we just add water , or a little bit of an eg@@ g if you &apos;re making a ca@@ ke or something .
because it &apos;s an id@@ eal . it &apos;s an imagin@@ ary thing . we can &apos;t have it .
and this is a community project i vis@@ ited recently in tor@@ onto .
we know we are what we eat .
en@@ ab@@ ling me to speak to a much , much wi@@ der audience than i could have ever conce@@ ived .
and i want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educ@@ ate and stimul@@ ate compas@@ sionate thinking .
and we learn am@@ ity .
so , whenever given an opportunity , i try to do something in it or with it or for it .
and here &apos;s a line of text that actually evol@@ ves from the ex@@ hau@@ st of a s@@ co@@ ot@@ er zi@@ pping across the page .
over the sp@@ an@@ ish steps we go .
at the end of lunch , they un@@ tie the an@@ ch@@ or , they set off through the ba@@ ths of car@@ ac@@ al@@ la and over the walls of the city and then an aban@@ don@@ ed g@@ at@@ e@@ house
but he &apos;s not happy ; something &apos;s wrong .
there &apos;s a very th@@ in blue line of ex@@ hau@@ st that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the tr@@ ail that holds it all together .
no fol@@ dou@@ ts , no tric@@ ks -- just a book that isn &apos;t open the whole way .
he lives in this little gar@@ r@@ et --
this is one of those things i show to my students because it &apos;s a complete ba@@ star@@ di@@ z@@ ation -- a den@@ ial of any rules of perspective .
mit resear@@ cher sky@@ lar ti@@ b@@ bits works on self-@@ ass@@ em@@ bly -- the idea that instead of building something , we can create materials that build themselves , much the way a str@@ and of dna zi@@ ps itself together . it &apos;s a big concept at early st@@ ages ; ti@@ b@@ bits shows us three in-@@ the-@@ lab projects that h@@ int at what a self-@@ assembl@@ ing future might look like .
the first two are the mac@@ robot and dec@@ i@@ bo@@ t .
so they have all of the information em@@ be@@ dded in them of what was construc@@ ted .
so i think these projects i &apos;ve showed here are just a tiny step towards this future , if we impl@@ ement these new technologies for a new self-@@ assembl@@ ing world .
he came up with a name for his myster@@ y agent .
at first we thought that perhaps this was arti@@ fact .
no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays this idea has a dra@@ matic name : spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p earth .
that &apos;s how big and how dark the universe is .
so we are a chemical s@@ cu@@ m that is different . this chemical s@@ cu@@ m has univers@@ ality .
and lo@@ cally there you could build parti@@ cle acceler@@ ators , and learn el@@ ement@@ ary parti@@ cle physics , and chemistry , and so on .
because if it &apos;s true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co2 emissions with something like the k@@ yo@@ to proto@@ co@@ l , with its con@@ str@@ a@@ ints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is , then that is already a disaster by any reas@@ on@@ able measure .
crai@@ g v@@ enter on dna and the sea
for example , it was thought that the visual pig@@ ments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pig@@ ments .
syn@@ thetic dna , the ability to syn@@ thes@@ ize dna , has changed at sort of the same pace that dna se@@ qu@@ encing has over the last decade or two , and is getting very rap@@ id and very cheap .
basically , any virus that &apos;s been se@@ qu@@ enced today -- that genome can be made .
so we know lots of different path@@ ways , thousands of different organisms now that live off of co2 , and can capture that back .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and n@@ el@@ son is stuck studying under the stre@@ et@@ lights .
we &apos;ve got to find ways to build up , as well .
so after the four special zones , there were 14 co@@ ast@@ al c@@ ites that were open in the same sense ,
we also need the choices for people .
let us have a hong k@@ ong near@@ by .
we &apos;d go from three percent of the ar@@ able land , to four percent .
let me conclu@@ de with this picture .
of teen@@ age girls who ple@@ d@@ ged sexu@@ al ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence and virgin@@ ity until marriage -- thank you george bush -- the majority , 60 percent , y@@ i@@ el@@ ded to sexu@@ al temp@@ tations within one year .
because their focus is what is now .
what you get from the present he@@ don@@ ism is the energy , the energy to explore yourself , places , people , sen@@ su@@ ality .
and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this , there &apos;s satur@@ n . and we have been to satur@@ n before -- we vis@@ ited satur@@ n in the early 198@@ 0s -- but our investi@@ g@@ ations of satur@@ n have become far more in-@@ dep@@ th in detail since the cass@@ in@@ i spac@@ ec@@ r@@ aft , traveling across inter@@ plan@@ et@@ ary space for seven years , gli@@ ded into or@@ bit around satur@@ n in the summer of 2004 , and became at that point the far@@ th@@ est robo@@ tic out@@ post that humanity had ever estab@@ li@@ shed around the sun .
it &apos;s a con@@ den@@ sable in the atmosphere , and so recogni@@ zing this circum@@ st@@ ance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities . you can have meth@@ ane clou@@ ds , ok , and above those clou@@ ds , you have this hundreds of kilometers of ha@@ ze , which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface .
but we couldn &apos;t make sense of our images , until , six months after we got into or@@ bit , an event occurred that many have regard@@ ed as the high@@ light of cass@@ in@@ i &apos;s investi@@ gation of titan .
so , this is the picture you would have at the window of ti@@ tan@@ ian air@@ lines as you fly across the surface of titan .
just to show you the size . this is not meant to be a threat .
but as if that weren &apos;t brilliant enough , we can spot , in this beautiful image , sight of our own planet , cr@@ ad@@ led in the arms of satur@@ n &apos;s r@@ ings .
but the top story of this past year was the economy ,
but my pick for the top long news story of this past year was this one : water found on the moon .
and this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere .
about seven years ago , they fac@@ ed extinction , because israel announ@@ ced it would build a separ@@ ation barri@@ er , and part of this barri@@ er would be built on top of the village . they would lose 40 percent of their land and be surr@@ ounded , so they would lose free access to the rest of the west bank .
prot@@ es@@ ter : this is a pe@@ ac@@ eful mar@@ ch .
so we organized a scre@@ ening .
and yet , they &apos;re just a computer company .
and by &quot; why &quot; i don &apos;t mean &quot; to make a profit . &quot;
here &apos;s our new car :
and they can make perfectly well-@@ designed products --
because the part of the brain that contr@@ ols decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making doesn &apos;t control language .
then how come we &apos;ve never heard of sam@@ u@@ el pi@@ er@@ pont lang@@ ley ?
but why is it important to attr@@ act those who believe what you believe ?
it &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
we don &apos;t need it . we don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s what they believed about america that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in washington in the middle of aug@@ ust .
so we &apos;ll start with the hip@@ po@@ camp@@ us , shown in yellow , which is the organ of memory .
and indeed , on the in@@ puts to the hip@@ po@@ camp@@ us , cells are found which project into the hip@@ po@@ camp@@ us , which do respond exactly to det@@ ecting boun@@ dar@@ ies or ed@@ ges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it &apos;s explor@@ ing around .
so we can put people in an m@@ ri scanner and have them do a little video game like the one i showed you and look for this signal .
this is ver@@ d@@ un , a batt@@ le@@ field in france just north of the na@@ to head@@ quar@@ ters in bel@@ gi@@ um .
this is an attack on the global comm@@ ons .
this is where al q@@ a@@ ed@@ a is st@@ aged from .
now , we are also teaching them combat skills , of course , but i would argue , open-source security means connec@@ ting in ways that create longer la@@ sting security effect .
why do we want to get in these nets ?
it &apos;s a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together .
