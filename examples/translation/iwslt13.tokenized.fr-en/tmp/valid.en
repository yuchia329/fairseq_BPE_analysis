the connection between ocean health and human health is actually based upon another couple simple adages ,
they accumulate into the top of it .
now , the mother then can go and reproduce , but what a terrible price to pay for the accumulation of this pollutant in these animals -- the death of the first-born calf .
because mothers who may be breastfeeding , who may have young children , would be buying something that they thought was healthy , but it was really toxic .
now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park where you had a big sign at the front saying , &quot; closed because human sewage is so far over this park that you can &apos;t use it &quot; ?
that has sparked cholera epidemics in ports along the world and has led to increased concentration on trying to make sure shipping doesn &apos;t move these vectors of cholera around the world .
that change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift , not only in the fortunes of monterey bay , but other places around the world .
they get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
handspring puppet co . : the genius puppetry behind war horse
so we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up-to-the-minute 17th century technology -- to turn nouns into verbs .
bj : but it had to ride . it had to have a rider .
we opened the lid , we took the horse out , and it did work ; it walked and it was able to be ridden .
ak : joey , joey , joey , joey .
but we realized that , if that were to be happening , you wouldn &apos;t , as an audience , see the breath .
thank you . thank you .
instead , what i want to do is talk about the philanthropy of all of us :
omidyar network has made a big investment in donorschoose .
you can look to these innovators to help us especially with things that require technological or scientific solution .
many of you will realize that i &apos;m ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer vernor vinge &apos;s notion of a technological singularity , where a number of trends accelerate and converge and come together to create , really , a shockingly new reality .
and i want you to imagine that it &apos;s 100 years from now , and your grandchild , or great-grandchild , or niece or nephew or god-child , is looking at this photograph of you .
now , you may push the car to the limits not because you &apos;re driving too fast , but because you &apos;ve hit an icy patch of road , conditions have changed .
so as researchers , that &apos;s what we decided to find out .
not surprisingly , you can see this is a pretty challenging task .
can , in fact , the technology not simply replace humans , but allow us to reach the level of reflex and intuition that we &apos;re all capable of ?
academic research on instant messaging also shows 100 people on buddy lists , but fundamentally people chat with two , three , four -- anyway , less than five .
and finally , finally , they &apos;ve managed to put instant messaging on their computers at work .
and of course , the major thing : learn to pay attention , to concentrate and focus your attention .
and every day , every single day , i read news that makes me cringe , like a $ 15 fine to kids in texas , for using , every time they take out their mobile phone in school .
and lots of people know that l.a. has its issues .
and the coal companies just move on after the mountain was emptied , leaving even more unemployment in their wake .
but these three people don &apos;t know each other , but they do have an awful lot in common .
mega agricultural operations often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land , and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product that costs us billions in healthcare and lost productivity .
the sum of the local is the global .
i spent some years watching how good intentions for community empowerment , that were supposed to be there to support the community and empower it , actually left people in the same , if not worse , position that they were in before .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and we were able to grow cherry tomatoes and cucumbers , all kinds of stuff .
if we really want to see the kind of wide consumer behavior change that we &apos;re all talking about as environmentalists and food people , maybe we just need to ditch the term &quot; consumer &quot; and get behind the people who are doing stuff .
and probably , if i were to fill out jim citrin &apos;s scale , i &apos;d put 100 percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative .
it &apos;s really important . using applications is ok , but programming is absolutely fundamental .
you want a separate thing , like the ac adaptor .
if you &apos;re in a desert , they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart .
not something you &apos;d envy or want to do .
and it &apos;s not to go out and buy 100 or 1,000 , though , i invite you to do that , and 10,000 would be even better .
and when i look out in the future , i can &apos;t imagine a world , 500 years from now , where we don &apos;t have robots everywhere . assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future -- assuming we &apos;re still around , i can &apos;t imagine the world not being populated with robots .
this is a robot that you can go out and buy , and that will clean up your floor .
we had the robots down at the world trade center late that evening .
he sort of does that . but i &apos;m going to -- chris anderson : i &apos;m just british . rb : oh .
it looks for highly saturated colors , from toys .
and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre-linguistically .
and i want you to watch carefully , at the beginning of this , where this person , ritchie , who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes -- -- says , &quot; i want to show you something .
it &apos;s all mechanistic . we are mechanism .
a story , a work of art , a face , a designed object -- how do we tell that something is beautiful ? and why does it matter so much to us ? designer richard seymour explores our response to beauty and the surprising power of objects that exhibit it .
and then somebody , i think it was bmw , introduced a light that went out slowly .
now i &apos;m not a neuroscientist .
now i &apos;m going to tell you what it is . are you ready ?
poignancy is a word i love as a designer .
and as a designer , i can &apos;t help meddling with this , so i pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this , and tried to understand what the individual elements were , but feeling it as i go .
i &apos;m getting terribly excited as my mind and my eyes flick across these things .
pretty ? yes .
and part of the joy of it is , you know the difficulty .
what &apos;s incredible about this , and the way i love to come back to it , is this is taking something that you hate or bores you , folding clothes , and if you can actually do this -- who can actually do this ? anybody try to do this ?
and for the last decade or so , it &apos;s been quite clear what being an atheist means .
i think there are ways -- and i &apos;m being both very respectful and completely impious -- of stealing from religions .
if you went to a top university -- let &apos;s say you went to harvard or oxford or cambridge -- and you said , &quot; i &apos;ve come here because i &apos;m in search of morality , guidance and consolation ; i want to know how to live , &quot; they would show you the way to the insane asylum .
another point about education : we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once , they &apos;ll remember it .
this comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings .
you immerse yourself in the water , and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea .
art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith .
they group together , they form institutions .
look very closely at pilgrimage .
there &apos;s so much we can absorb .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and i went to see one of these experiments , and this is actually -- you can barely see it , and the reason for that is it &apos;s entirely dark in there --
so they wait until winter -- the lake is completely frozen over -- and they use this meter-thick ice as a platform on which to establish their ice camp and do their work .
an extraordinary set of telescopes .
what i want you to imagine is this is two tons in weight .
and i would like to share with you a launch .
carved above their door is , &quot; free to all . &quot; it &apos;s kind of an inspiring statement , and i &apos;ll go back at the end of this .
then the question is , what do you get ?
and this is the opening day at the library of alexandria , the new library of alexandria , in egypt .
you actually can go and read scanned books quite easily .
and with two digital , high-grade , professional digital cameras , controlled museum lighting , so even if it &apos;s a black and white book , you can go and get the proper intonation .
but anyway , loaning out-of-print works from the boston public library , the woods hole oceanographic institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program , to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over .
they give permission , and we get about 40 or 50 concerts a day .
so 15 dollars per video hour , and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour , we &apos;re able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the net .
the question is , is that the world that we really want to live in ?
flowers will arrive by the truckload .
i love a challenge , and saving the earth is probably a good one .
fungi don &apos;t like to rot from bacteria , and so our best antibiotics come from fungi .
the mycelium is sentient .
all across most land masses .
some of these mushrooms are very happy mushrooms .
this is extremely rare fungus .
i did something that nobody else had done .
the life box -- you &apos;re gonna be getting a dvd of the ted conference -- you add soil , you add water , you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores , like of the agarikon mushroom .
and the wonderful thing about that is that i get to compare biospheres . and hopefully from that i get to learn something .
but of course none of that happened .
when i breathed out , my co2 fed the sweet potatoes that i was growing .
and we had sleep apnea at night .
because , in fact , although you might say we had discovered something that was quite &quot; uhh , &quot; when your oxygen is going down , stopped working , essentially , in your life support system , that &apos;s a very bad failure .
so i went about my business : paragon space development corporation , a little firm i started with people while i was in the biosphere , because i had nothing else to do .
and what this project was doing was taking the effluent of these , and turning them into all of this food .
it &apos;s a certain type of aesthetic .
there may be some carbon in your breath from the dinosaurs .
we think perhaps it &apos;s a combination of factors .
i mean , there may be 100 explanations for why haiti is the impoverished nation it is , but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor .
of course , the real importance for bees is not the honey .
we also have the sweat bees , and these are little gems flying around .
it used to be , two , three hundred years ago , that a lawn was a symbol of prestige , and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green actually , deserts : they &apos;re totally sterile .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so , okay , i &apos;m going to america .
well actually , you are going to whistle along .
okay . it &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
let &apos;s have a look at this nice code that is coming from a renaissance book .
the blue whale , it &apos;s a dwarf if compared with the real biggest creature that exists on the planet -- that is , this wonderful , magnificent sequoiadendron giganteum .
but they are also able to sleep .
and in the last paragraph of the book , it &apos;s a kind of stylistic mark , because normally charles darwin stored , in the last paragraph of a book , the most important message .
you can remove 90 percent of the internet and it is &#91; continuing &#93; to work .
&lt; transcript &gt;
so at this point , she decides to put the rape book away .
as i started taking improv class at the upright citizens brigade theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians , i started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects .
there &apos;s a better photo of it .
they &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
so i &apos;d say over the years , one of the most common criticisms i see of improv everywhere left anonymously on youtube comments is : &quot; these people have too much time on their hands . &quot;
it &apos;s too slow to get a picture of conditions on the ground before they change , too expensive to implement in all the places that require testing .
dan dennett &apos;s response to rick warren
because i want to say that much the same thing is true of religions .
but also let them know about other religions .
i know many religions are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths .
francis crick , the co-discoverer of the structure of dna with jim watson , once joked about what he called orgel &apos;s second rule .
here &apos;s what he said .
i &apos;ll tell you what it is .
i &apos;ll give you a few quotes .
and , the means -- how does he do it ?
now some of this is a difference of opinion , and that &apos;s not my main complaint .
but then i read on and i read this : &quot; first , noah had never seen rain , because prior to the flood god irrigated the earth from the ground up . &quot;
he &apos;s better at arguing than you are , having had thousands of years to practice . &quot;
if you are like me , you know many wonderful , committed , engaged atheists , agnostics , who are being very good without god .
whereas hearing is passive , listening is something that we have to work at --
it looks a bit like this .
if you can &apos;t hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice , it &apos;s too loud .
first of all , listen consciously .
i want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that , by far , most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light .
but if we were freely falling through the space , even without this helpful grid , we might be able to paint it ourselves , because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines , undeflected straight paths through the universe .
it &apos;s actually not massive enough .
it would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel , but it &apos;s a total death experience .
the sound you &apos;re hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
but the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
it gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing cave paintings .
nalini nadkarni : life science in prison
of the 100 incarcerated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
but if trees can create art , if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year , if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs , then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves , like grief , like addictions , like racism , that can also change .
one has to discover a certain bigness in oneself .
compassion is not defined in one form .
there &apos;s no choice in this :
to discover compassion , you need to be compassionate .
with these words , thank you very much .
we are there to inspire , to provoke , to mobilize , to bring hope to our people .
and i fell into a life in exile .
these are some of the images and the characters of the film .
we can integrate over the surface , and the notation usually is a capital sigma .
they can just watch those videos . if they &apos;re bored , they can go ahead .
and then a few other things started to dawn on me .
and the khan academy videos are there .
and they all fit together .
green means the student &apos;s already proficient .
and we &apos;re seeing it over and over and over again .
i &apos;m still doing all the videos , but we have a rockstar team doing the software .
do you think a lot of classes next school year should try this thing out ?
they don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
i see cats and dogs walking towards me . they come to a certain point and then stop .
but she was blind .
and in 1759 , he described to his grandson various things he was seeing .
the things you see can be very complicated indeed .
and these frightened her .
the charles bonnet ones are quite different .
so you may not only have &quot; car &quot; cells , you may have &quot; aston martin &quot; cells .
there must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
ca : that was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
but just to try to prove that fact to you , i &apos;ve brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration .
and you normally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets .
now if you poke it , it pulls in its tentacles .
it &apos;s just 16 blue leds that we can program to do different types of displays .
that &apos;s a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark .
thank you .
don &apos;t worry . many of the most successful scientists at work today are mathematically semi-literate .
in selecting a subject in which to conduct original research , or to develop world-class expertise , take a part of the chosen discipline that is sparsely inhabited .
this first of the two strategies is like a hunter , exploring a forest in search of a particular quarry , who finds other quarries along the way .
and this idea is actually nothing new .
and it &apos;s from x-ray crystallography , so it &apos;s an accurate model of dna .
so to keep the dna organized and regulate access to the genetic code , it &apos;s wrapped around these purple proteins -- or i &apos;ve labeled them purple here .
so this is a single chromosome .
so with a little bit of molecular eye candy , we &apos;ve got kinesins , which are the orange ones .
the form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive .
and in the many-to-many era , every desktop is now a printing press , a broadcasting station , a community or a marketplace .
they will not play the game again , they don &apos;t know each other ,
principles , and those principles seem to be missing from those institutions that don &apos;t work .
ebay solved the prisoner &apos;s dilemma and created a market where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism that turns a prisoner &apos;s dilemma game into an assurance game .
what forms of suffering could be alleviated , what forms of wealth could be created if we knew a little bit more about cooperation ?
these little green bubbles represent photosynths that users have made .
i &apos;m live . all right . there we go .
and that &apos;s curtis wong , worldwide telescope .
the khmer rouge closes the doors to the outside world .
and she decided , despite the advice of her neighbors , that she would take the chance and claim to be vietnamese so that we could have a chance to survive ,
and i got word last month that the complaint was officially accepted by the khmer rouge tribunal .
one day a man told me , &quot; my future does not look brilliant , but i want to have a brilliant future for my son . &quot;
and the afghan sense of the future is shattered .
and they are working with me up to today .
but now i know , because i am part of a nucleus of a new peaceful society in afghanistan . &quot;
in its essence , the orchestra and the choir are much more than artistic structures . they are examples and schools of social life , because to sing and to play together means to intimately coexist toward perfection and excellence , following a strict discipline of organization and coordination in order to seek the harmonic interdependence
all this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic .
&lt; transcript &gt;
you have to just do it twice , you have to touch the screen and then rotate your finger slightly --
now , imagine a screen , which is not only touch-sensitive now , it &apos;s pressure-sensitive .
filmmakers , for example , are the experts in monologue making :
narrator : when i find a chapter that i want to see , i just touch the text and the system will format pages for me to read .
we did it in some pretty rough areas of new york city .
the child read beautifully , it turned out , and was really very competent . so it actually meant something .
but rooted in that , little did she know how much knowledge she was acquiring about geometry and just math and logic and all the rest .
now , we track , on the person &apos;s head , the head motions --
all right ? very big differences between the way i answered the phone the three times .
this is some of the field work that we &apos;ve done .
the first boomer actually , we didn &apos;t even wait till 2011 , next year .
we have to shift from this mainframe mentality of healthcare to a personal model of healthcare .
this is what was happening to mimi ; the family was worried about it , moved her out of her own home into an assisted living facility .
that &apos;s sort of the state of the art .
so , 10,000 households or bust .
the job of uncovering the global food waste scandal started for me when i was 15 years old .
any dot above that line , and you &apos;ll quickly notice that that includes most countries in the world , represents unnecessary surplus , and is likely to reflect levels of waste in each country .
that food goes to waste before it even leaves the fields .
off the market shelves that hungry people depend on .
the one on the right i treated like cut flowers .
renowned paleontologist jack horner has spent his career trying to reconstruct a dinosaur . he &apos;s found fossils with extraordinarily well-preserved blood vessels and soft tissues , but never intact dna . so , in a new approach , he &apos;s taking living descendants of the dinosaur and genetically engineering them to reactivate ancestral traits — including teeth , tails , and even hands — to make a &quot; chickenosaurus &quot; .
we have found a lot of evidence that dinosaurs changed from when they were juveniles to when they were adults .
back in 1993 when the movie came out , we actually had a grant from the national science foundation to attempt to extract dna from a dinosaur ,
we gave samples to mary schweitzer , and she was actually able to determine that b-rex was a female based on medullary tissue found on the inside of the bone .
so the non-avian dinosaurs are the big clunky ones that went extinct .
you take a glow gene out of a coral or a jellyfish and you stick it in a zebrafish , and , puff , they glow .
and i said , &quot; well , if you can find those , i can just reverse them and make what i need to make for the sixth-graders . &quot;
well , that &apos;s a good question .
if they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
what they &apos;ll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the iranian nuclear facility .
and so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other .
and so i think that this is actually , of all the problems you &apos;re going to hear about at the conference , this is probably one of the very easiest to fix .
there &apos;re some very delightful names .
&quot; no , no , really , i &apos;m so busy with the stars .
&quot; now , frank is this clear to you , djabran fluctus ? &quot;
&quot; yeah , go to your room . &quot;
which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads .
so , maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge . now this is isaac from a vietnamese stamp .
this is , of course , the cartesian coordinates .
i know that scares a lot of you , but that was my purpose entirely .
there is so many intricate relationships that i &apos;m not going to go there now , because you would say , &quot; hey , go back to the fluctus part . &quot;
unbelievable . this is like crazy .
guy-philippe goldstein : how cyberattacks threaten real-world peace
it gets even more complicated when the doctrines of use become ambiguous .
but in doing so , they also add their own risk of triggering a conflict -- as we &apos;ve just seen , a very important risk -- and a risk we may have to confront with a collective security solution which includes all of us : european allies , nato members , our american friends and allies , our other western allies , and maybe , by forcing their hand a little , our russian and chinese partners .
this is what i saw . i saw hills and valleys .
so , what i &apos;d like to do now is try a little drawing .
try and inflate it .
for instance , i took them skiing in the mid-atlantic range , which is this range of mountains in the middle of the atlantic .
the third storyline i did about a year and a half ago was probably my most difficult .
thanks .
and that &apos;s what i hope my comic strip does in a small way .
audience : 47 .
woman : 1369 . ab : 1369 .
ab : 321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
so , since we &apos;ve reached the limits of our calculators -- what &apos;s that ? does yours go -- woman : i don &apos;t know .
you have a seven-digit number , call out any six of them please .
audience : october . ab : october what ?
this is a book of calendars , and i &apos;ll ask -- who was it that wanted to know their birth day ? you sir ? ok .
but to make my job more interesting for you , as well as for me , i &apos;m going to do this problem thinking out loud .
there &apos;s definitely a method to my madness -- definitely , definitely . sorry .
first off , my badge says i &apos;m an astronomer .
in fact , i think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
if you take two mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and i make them out of glass .
we &apos;re studying physics , i &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; that &apos;s a good thing to do .
is true . is true . i teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
and there &apos;s no time to do it .
so , i &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
i &apos;m saying , &quot; i got to clear out of here ! &quot;
it is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot;
by buying a space that was 420 sq. ft. instead of 600 , immediately i &apos;m saving 200 grand .
my bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
you see any adults ?
and it is a marvelous example of how a differential in power can be overridden by a process of nature that &apos;s within all of us .
and there &apos;s a whole other type of play , which is object play .
preschool kids , for example , should be allowed to dive , hit , whistle , scream , be chaotic , and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive , emotional and physical -- that come as a part of rough and tumble play .
i &apos;m sorry i don &apos;t have a playful-looking subject , but it allows mobility , which has limited the actual study of play .
the basis of human trust is established through play signals .
at least in public .
an important key insight that we learned about meetings is that people pack them in one after another , disruptive to the day .
and its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain .
the champagne grapes that you see are actually carbonated grapes . a little bit of seafood and some crème fraiche and the picture actually tastes exactly like the dish .
and basically the reaction tends to be kind of like this .
i told the staff , let &apos;s just take a bunch of wild plants , think of them as food ingredients . as long as they &apos;re non-poisonous to the human body , go out around chicago sidewalks , take it , blend it , cook it and then have everybody flavor-trip on it at moto .
and when we take out the u.s. and look at the remaining 21 percent , we see a lot of iraq -- that &apos;s that big green thing there -- and little else .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so if we &apos;re going to study viral chatter , we need to get to these populations who have intensive contact with wild animals .
these individuals are at specific risk , particularly if there &apos;s blood contact , they &apos;re at risk for transmission and possibly infection with novel viruses .
so , in 1998 , along with my mentors don burke and colonel mpoudi-ngole , we went to actually start this work in central africa , to work with hunters in this part of the world .
early on , in order to ship our specimens , we had to have dry ice . to get dry ice we had to go to the breweries -- beg , borrow , steal to get these folks to give it to us .
it had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves , and thought about ourselves .
i want people to discover themselves as actors , as creative actors , by having interactive experiences .
and he said one of them is called maluma .
and it &apos;s almost impossible to perform .
and so those are the questions that are happening in the next projects .
and i &apos;m going to show a video of the older version of it , which is just a minute long . okay .
those are its targets .
and in my case , when i hit send , up to 60,000 people will receive that message in a matter of seconds .
oh ... &quot; evan williams is just dying on stage here at ted .
and for many years afterwards , i would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer .
and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made .
the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from lagos two days ago , in which there was an announcement on the virgin flight about the charity work in &quot; india , africa and other countries . &quot;
there were endless stories of mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system , sneaking across the border , being arrested at the border , that sort of thing .
but the truth is that i had a very happy childhood , full of laughter and love , in a very close-knit family .
what the nigerian writer chinua achebe calls &quot; a balance of stories . &quot;
and it is amazing to me how many people apply , how many people are eager to write , to tell stories .
and i am sitting by my father &apos;s bedside in hospital , trying to work out whether i should let him drink the one-and-a-half-liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said , &quot; you must make him drink today , &quot; -- my father &apos;s been nil by mouth for a week -- or whether , by giving him this bottle , i might actually kill him .
so in order to help you understand where i &apos;m coming from , let me bring you into my world , the world of experts .
it recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first , primarily on male animals and then , primarily on men .
thank you .
so we &apos;re bound with the laws of physics and the laws of economics .
you don &apos;t do it as a human being . you do it as a machine .
nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car .
that &apos;s how i solved it in my head . it was a white paper i handed out to governments .
so if you want to buy a gasoline car in denmark , it costs you about 60,000 euros .
so the price of oil , much like lots of other curves that we &apos;ve seen , goes along a depletion curve .
that is 0.5 percent of the u.s. oil consumption .
very interesting . the car industry has been focused just on themselves .
and when we go to cop15 at the end of this year
and the industrial revolution started within less than one year .
the war is so worrying at present , with court cases coming up in one state after another , that i felt i had to say something about it .
but that &apos;s putting it too negatively .
he begins by explaining how science works through the testing of hypotheses that are framed to be vulnerable to disproof , and then he goes on .
&quot; no , i don &apos;t know that atheists should be considered citizens , nor should they be considered patriots .
why does this far more substantial minority not make a move to exercise its political muscle ?
in most cases , people who out themselves will help to destroy the myth that there is something wrong with atheists .
now , a friend , an intelligent lapsed jew , who incidentally observed the sabbath for reasons of cultural solidarity , describes himself as a &quot; tooth fairy agnostic . &quot;
&quot; non-theist &quot; will do for all that , yet unlike &quot; atheist , &quot; it doesn &apos;t have the same phobic , hysterical responses .
thank you very much , chris . everybody who came up here said they were scared . i don &apos;t know if i &apos;m scared , but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this .
and that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight .
one in four sub-saharan africans is nigerian , and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people -- but very interesting people . you &apos;ll never be bored .
the other thing we &apos;ve also done is to manage our finances better .
and now , we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall are doing four times the turnover that they had projected .
and i want to just make one point about this investment .
think about the beatrices , think about the adenikes of this world , who are doing incredible things , that are bringing them into the global economy , whilst at the same time making sure that their fellow men and women are employed , and that the children in those households get educated because their parents are earning adequate income .
the japanese had , for the first time , created the fastest supercomputer -- the nec earth simulator -- taking the primary from the u.s. , and about two years later -- this , by the way , is measuring the trillion floating-point operations per second that the computer &apos;s capable of running --
another portion is not only how content is produced , but how relevance is produced .
but what we &apos;re seeing now is the emergence of this fourth system of social sharing and exchange .
you build platforms for self-expression and collaboration .
a few years ago , professor vaclav smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history .
or polio ? how many of you remember the iron lung ?
by that time , the battle against hiv would already have been lost .
and it quickly hides itself in your genome .
this strategy , working backwards
so if this works in humans , what we &apos;re talking about is a universal flu vaccine , one that doesn &apos;t need to change every year and would remove the threat of death .
and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu .
so if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments , we will master these and new tools of vaccinology ,
ca : and malaria &apos;s even further behind ?
the hippo generation are the ruling elites . they are stuck in their intellectual patch . complaining about colonialism and imperialism , they wouldn &apos;t move one foot .
capital flight out of africa , 80 billion a year .
the second false premise that we make when we &apos;re trying to help africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in africa that cares about its people , serves the interests of the people , and represents the people .
more than 80 percent of ivory coast &apos;s development went into the modern sector .
in the economic system in traditional africa , the means of production is privately owned .
that is not the kind of system africans had known for centuries .
stewart brand on squatter cities
that &apos;s the news from downtown . here it is in perspective .
they disappeared .
so i do think this is a problem .
and the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society .
and i say that sincerely , partly because -- -- i need that ! put yourselves in my position !
and i looked and there was a man running across the runway .
cars and trucks -- i talked about that in the slideshow , but i want you to put it in perspective .
the movie comes out -- the movie is a movie version of the slideshow i gave two nights ago , except it &apos;s a lot more entertaining . and it comes out in may .
you have more influence than some of us who are democrats do .
we &apos;re warming the climate .
it &apos;s really messy .
i think it &apos;s being hidden on purpose .
now , in the exxon valdez spill , about 30 percent of the killer whales died in the first few months .
there are a lot of birds in the gulf that concentrate in the gulf at certain times of the year , but then leave .
there are hundreds of shrimp boats employed to drag booms instead of nets .
now there are things that we can do in the future .
we &apos;re either going to have an absolutely unmitigated catastrophe of this oil leak in the gulf , or we will make the moment we need out of this , as many people have noted today .
our genes seem to have awesome power over our destinies .
there &apos;s a diagram like this for your brain , but there &apos;s no way it would fit on this slide .
and still , you may not see the branches .
it doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re a guy or girl , everyone &apos;s brains are like spaghetti .
and some day , artificially intelligent supercomputers will analyze the images without human assistance to summarize them in a connectome .
and it might true that just the mere act of thinking can change your connectome -- an idea that you may find empowering .
because , if the first neurons in the chain are activated , through their synapses they send messages to the second neurons , which are activated , and so on down the line , like a chain of falling dominoes .
one of their most cherished dreams is to cheat death by that practice known as cryonics .
we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties . over the last three years , we found over 200 of these things , and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted .
because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours . he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now .
and i have it right here in my pocket .
zk : i &apos;d just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target .
while he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
zk : now , this technology was developed by these two guys : professor ken suslick and neil rakow , of the university of illinois .
and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said , &quot; look , hydrophobic string . &quot;
can we produce a menu that &apos;s delicious without foie gras ?
&quot; spanish chef accused of cheating . &quot;
he &apos;s really just in love with -- he &apos;s at one with -- he &apos;s the goose whisperer .
he electrifies only the outside .
they get what they want , they leave the rest for me and i sell it .
and we &apos;re sitting there , and i hear &#91; clapping &#93; from a distance , so i look over .
they don &apos;t need anything more . &quot;
and i &apos;m not like some super taster , you know ?
and as he said , i think fittingly , it &apos;s a gift from god , with god saying , you &apos;ve done good work .
the pharaoh got wind of this and wanted to taste it .
he said , &quot; if all the insects disappeared , life on earth as we know it would disappear within 50 years .
but i &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
so now i &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; the harvesters &quot; by pieter bruegel at the met .
so another one of my favorites , &quot; the starry night . &quot;
thank you .
after , there is people like me , who try to deserve to exist , and who are so ashamed to make this useless job , who try to do it in another way , and they try , i try , to not make the object for the object but for the result , for the profit for the human being , the person who will use it .
after , we become a fish ; after , we become a frog ; after , we become a monkey ; after , we become what we are today : a super-monkey , and the fun is , the super-monkey we are today , is at half of the story .
i can explain you . i shall try .
come back . because , after , there is another trap .
because it &apos;s not , the barbaria we have today , it &apos;s perhaps not the barbaria we think .
and the beauty of this , in perhaps 50 years , 60 years , we can finish completely this civilization ,
in fact , they have more control over the loss of control than ever before .
take the travel service nextpedition .
no one was a hero . no one was a hero .
and that psychological barrier of fear had worked for so many years , and here comes the internet , technology , blackberry , sms .
because of the internet , the truth prevailed and everyone knew the truth .
everything was done by the people to the people , and that &apos;s the power of the internet .
all the stereotypes that the regime was trying to put on us through their so-called propaganda , or mainstream media , are proven wrong .
i want you to take a look at this baby .
well , babies all over the world are what i like to describe as &quot; citizens of the world . &quot; they can discriminate all the sounds of all languages , no matter what country we &apos;re testing and what language we &apos;re using ,
it &apos;s raising lots of questions about bilingual people .
the social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and we run clinics in these very remote regions where there &apos;s no medical care whatsoever .
and i realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience , from working with dying people and training caregivers , that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe .
but compassion , the generation of compassion , actually mobilizes our immunity .
he sees that the dog has this big wound on its leg .
because if you only have the iranian passport , you &apos;re kind of limited to the countries you can go to with open arms , you know -- syria , venezuela , north korea .
but as you can see , when i talk , i speak with an american accent , which you would think as an iranian-american actor , i should be able to play any part , good , bad , what have you .
and one thing that happened there was also the pakistani taliban took credit for that failed car bombing .
he goes , &quot; i &apos;m going to the zara store . it &apos;s three miles away .
and i forgot there &apos;s obviously successful indians in dubai as well .
he had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes .
announcer : one five will get you 10 , 10 will get you 20 .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so , this is exactly what i did .
so , because i am a trained economist and i think in economic terms , all of the sudden i thought , maybe there is something here .
now , again we see a mix of legal and illegal activities .
this is about twice the gdp of the united kingdom , soon will be more , considering where this country is going .
and it is , in fact , an anti-money-laundering legislation .

i thought there were them and there were us , and i was not one of them .
but what can you do ? you &apos;re in the middle of the ocean . oars are your only means of propulsion .
question number two : how do you sleep ?
and to row in a straight line across it would be about 8,000 miles .
but it doesn &apos;t react very well to being immersed in ocean , which is what happened to it .
it &apos;s that little green sliver on the horizon ,
the second point is about the accumulation of tiny actions .
we just want to try and create that awareness because , sure , changing a light bulb isn &apos;t going to change the world , but that attitude , that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb or take your reusable coffee mug , that is what could change the world .
and i think that &apos;s what i &apos;d like to talk about today .
now , i don &apos;t know what you think , but i think this is a pretty stupid decision , because what you &apos;ve done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever .
does everybody know what a camera obscura is ?
and they said , well , it &apos;s summer , what do you do ?
here we &apos;re going to walk across the bridge at night . it &apos;s self-lit , you don &apos;t need any overhead lighting , so the neighbors don &apos;t complain about metal-halide lighting in their face .
this is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste . fizzy , fresh , soft , luscious , juicy , smooth , big and sweet wines , all explained to you by color and texture on the wall . and finally , it &apos;s about entertainment , as in his headquarters for the cirque du soleil , orlando , florida , where you &apos;re asked to enter the greek theater , look under the tent and join the magic world of cirque du soleil .
bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche , as she calls it , by exploding it into something spectacular .
he creates these opulent tableaus inspired by hieronymus bosch , but also by the kashmiri textiles of his youth .
and we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation , about shape , about color and so forth and it &apos;s very primal . and
ok now . arthur &#91; ganson &#93; hasn &apos;t talked yet , but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside . and so , we -- scott created this wonderful tribute to arthur ganson .
do you ever feel completely overwhelmed when you &apos;re faced with a complex problem ?
well , when i saw this in the front page of the times , i thought , &quot; great . finally something i can relate to .
it &apos;s true .
what i do is i write books about the cultural history of physics .
the frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals , and kelps , and sponges and nudibranchs , is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry .
i ask the question , how many lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line ? &quot; and you all know the answer . does someone want to shout it out ?
this is the drawing .
their answer was interesting .
which is where i first learned about hyperbolic space .
well , there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain .
and then , as you grow up , the cortex develops , and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother .
which you can completely ignore .
by the way , if this patient then goes , and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him -- and he picks up the phone , and he says , &quot; wow , mom , how are you ? where are you ? &quot; there &apos;s no delusion through the phone .
it &apos;s fixed in a clenched spasm and it &apos;s excruciatingly painful .
ok ? what you do is you create what i call a mirror box .
maybe , after a period of practice , you can dispense with the mirror , unlearn the paralysis , and start moving your paralyzed arm , and then , relieve yourself of pain . &quot; so he said ok , and he took it home .
bear in mind , these people are completely normal in other respects .
why would there be crossed wires in some people ?
how many of you think that &apos;s buba , that &apos;s kiki ? raise your hands .
so that &apos;s another project for nasa .
that &apos;s a challenge for 21st-century science .
we depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure .
in fact , some years ago , bill joy wrote an article expressing tremendous concern about robots taking us over , etc .
there &apos;s an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there , experiencing the sun &apos;s demise , but any life and intelligence that exists then will be as different from us as we are from bacteria .
metallic objects -- albeit very small ones , a few tons at most -- escaped into orbit around the earth .
and it &apos;s used for communication .
and she came to us when she was just at puberty , about six or seven years of age .
video : look at all this stuff that &apos;s here for our campfire .
this is her first time to try to drive a golf cart .
kanzi &apos;s rock is from gona , ethiopia and is identical to that used by our african ancestors two-and-a-half million years ago .
video : this lexigram also refers to a place in the woods .
do that real fast part that you did . yeah , that part .
tim berners-lee : the year open data went worldwide
how can you use this stuff ?
this is a real-time map that shows blocked roads , damaged buildings , refugee camps --
it exploded an arms race .
do you think you could do it ? i would like to see if this audience would -- no , you haven &apos;t practiced , as far as i know -- can you get it together to clap in sync ?
let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous .
even though it looks like they &apos;re thinking as a group , they &apos;re not .
the trees , mangrove trees , are filled with fireflies communicating with light .
if you have epilepsy , there is an instance of billions of brain cells , or at least millions , discharging in pathological concert .
i also want to wind this one up a bit . how can they communicate ?
interviewer : not up and down ? boy : no .
and especially if we start to walk like those people did , right ?
just by walking . interviewer : well , it &apos;s certainly going now .
and he described the diversity within crops -- all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such -- as a genetic resource .
and i want to give you an example of that .
and there are a couple of answers to that question .
the agricultural system and , more importantly , the crops in the field in india have never experienced this before .
it &apos;s as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane .
this is a backup system for world agriculture . it &apos;s a backup system for all the seed banks . storage is free .
but right now i would say we don &apos;t have a card catalog for it .
when working on laptop . however , they will adopt a less natural posture in order to balance it on their laps ,
and this research is being precipitated by the u.s. government ,
they need to look forward to exploration ; they need to look forward to colonization ; they need to look forward to breakthroughs .
the jet age started : the missile age started . von braun was on there showing how to go to mars -- and this was before sputnik .
you know , a good example , of course , is the darpa net .
oh , it &apos;s going to be so much fun .
but something is out there to inspire our kids now .
but anyway , i think we need to beat them again .
end to end , that would form a line that would circle the earth twice .
and on the other end , excessive angiogenesis -- too many blood vessels -- drives disease ,
and once those vessels invade the cancer , it can expand , it can invade local tissues .
here &apos;s a cancer growing on the lip of a wuarter horse named guinness .
our search for this has taken us to the market , the farm and to the spice cabinet , because what we &apos;ve discovered is that mother nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis .
and here are the dietary factors going head to head against these drugs .
stop the treatment , gains the weight back .
wl : well , you know , there &apos;s abundant epidemiological evidence .
one hint : it &apos;s not &quot; l. &quot;
it &apos;s a very small form , like a joke , a poem , a magic trick or a song , very compact form .
here &apos;s the word &quot; mirror . &quot; no , it &apos;s not the same upside-down . it &apos;s the same this way .
it &apos;s made by the company think fun .
cut up the dna , you sequence individual pieces , and then you look for overlaps ,
well , guess what ? that &apos;s changing .
but if you can see it , shout out the answer .
i want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness .
i went and i spent time in a place called bukavu in a hospital called the panzi hospital , with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person i &apos;ve ever met .
to pretend they &apos;re not a mess when they are a mess .
girls are trained to please .
and through her self-defense , she grabbed their adam &apos;s apples , she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car .
she imagined her father killing her on one hand , and mama agnes greeting her , with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house .
i can feel what you &apos;re feeling as you &apos;re feeling inside the feeling before .
and you know what ? sometimes it should .
and if he does this an infinite number of times , which you can do in mathematics , he ends up with an infinite number of lines , each of which has an infinite number of points in it .
they were breathing those words with fractal lungs .
i came up with this structure here .
second , you might ask , &quot; well , dr. eglash , aren &apos;t you ignoring the diversity of african cultures ? &quot; and three times , the answer is no .
here &apos;s a wonderful fractal .
so even plus odd gives you odd .
we &apos;ve also been working in design .
what i have here is a cinder block that we &apos;ve coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
you &apos;d think it &apos;d be smooth , but it &apos;s actually not .
two ted favorites , jill sobule and julia sweeney , team up for a delightful set that mixes witty songwriting with a little bit of social commentary .
it makes &quot; what the bleep do we know &quot; seem like a doctoral dissertation from harvard on quantum mechanics -- that &apos;s how bad it is .
or think about the fact that if you build an automobile , i &apos;ll tell you that you also -- inside it -- have to put a factory that allows you to make another automobile .
because it &apos;s very interesting . when you take this model and you perturb it , you give it a push , as it bumps into something , it self-stabilizes , with no brain or no reflexes , just by the structure alone .
it actually leaps into the air , and has aerial phases when it does it , like a horse , and you &apos;ll see it &apos;s bouncing here .
we have one here and notice its position . it &apos;s holding on .
here are the robots that they inspire , the mecho-geckos from irobot .
they don &apos;t have any glue , and they even stick under water just fine .
and it was invented in 1858 , by this guy ferdinand carre , but he couldn &apos;t actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time .
we think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
and i realized he doesn &apos;t know where the women &apos;s room is in his office .
so i &apos;m not saying that staying in the workforce is the right thing for everyone .
&quot; you got the top grade in the class ?
and she &apos;s an operator in a company in silicon valley , and she uses her contacts to become a very successful venture capitalist .
she said , &quot; well , you &apos;re giving this talk , and you said you were going to take two more questions .
here &apos;s what happens : we &apos;re all busy . everyone &apos;s busy . a woman &apos;s busy .
we are not going to get to where 50 percent of the population -- in my generation , there will not be 50 percent of &#91; women &#93; at the top of any industry .
i mean , they complain about it all the time .
so go brush and floss your teeth .
and i don &apos;t know if it works .
we should probably slow down , and that point of action is probably now .
there is no good faith in this .
they go right to doctors .
so that &apos;s our general blood work test .
why is wired magazine doing this ?
it works totally different from the way we talk about behavior in medicine today .
design -- i love its design .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
both of us were disseminating the genes of one species and not another ,
i had thought always -- and in fact , had written this in my first book ; this was a book about gardening -- that lawns were nature under culture &apos;s boot ,
but the weird thing is , we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later ;
and we came out with only 23,000 .
it &apos;s a very elaborate and beautiful dance , but i &apos;m going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it ,
and third , while they &apos;re in this paddock they are , of course , defecating madly and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field .
more for us , less for nature .
why ? it became a question my entire life , and that &apos;s all right , because being good at math meant he bought me a computer , and some of you remember this computer , this was my first computer .
and then movies , via cd-rom . it was amazing .
it &apos;s just amazing , fear . but that &apos;s form , content .
it has 10 variations .
because at risd , you have to look at the actual animal , the object , to understand its volume , to perceive it .
my favorite ones are &quot; no plants . &quot; why would you bring a plant to a national monument ? i &apos;m not sure . and also &quot; no love . &quot;
so what this is , is a kind of a sketch , an application sketch i wrote in python . you know how there &apos;s photoshop ?
and before i get started today , since many of you are wondering , i just wanted to get it out of the way .
australia , because there just aren &apos;t very many people there .
and so i guess the u.s. finally , finally started to like it , too .
but it was a dream of his , and we , basically , when people really want to do something , well , we generally let them .
and news , which i just mentioned , was started by a researcher . and he just -- he -- after 9 / 11 , he got really interested in the news .
all right , see ? you guys should try it out .
a lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other , and informally .
because you can type , you know , any kind of thing into google , and you expect an answer back , right ?
and we don &apos;t have this feature anymore .
and so i say that i want to build a game layer on top of the world , but that &apos;s not quite true because it &apos;s already under construction ; it &apos;s already happening .
if you &apos;re not , too bad . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
so i just recently dropped out of princeton and actually ended up for the first time in a bar , and i saw these happy hour things all over the place , right .
you should lose points for not doing this on time .
and it &apos;s very powerful .
these progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world .
we use game dynamics to build on it . we build with mindshare .
amusing ? yes . desirable ? maybe .
so somehow , we went from this to this .
instead of thinking about what to build , building in order to think .
so in one of their projects called southwark circle , they worked with residents in southwark , south london and a small team of designers to develop a new membership organization to help the elderly with household tasks .
what &apos;s the design brief ?
so i &apos;d like to believe that design thinking actually can make a difference , that it can help create new ideas and new innovations , beyond the latest high street products .
but from the japanese perspective , it &apos;s their duty to protect those who don &apos;t know any better -- in this case , the ignorant gaijin -- from making the wrong choice .
with this procedure , we were able to ensure that the kids across the three groups all did the same activity , making it easier for us to compare performance .
you will surely find the perfect match .
i don &apos;t mean to say that i want no choice , but many of these choices are quite artificial . &quot; in reality , many choices are between things that are not that much different .
if she survived , she would remain in a permanent vegetative state , never able to walk , talk or interact with others .
it &apos;s a great story , and it &apos;s understandable why they would be reluctant to revise it .
yeah , i -- as you would expect -- get pretty frustrated by choices like what nail polish to put on because i have to rely on what other people suggest .
now , of the women that could tell them apart , when the labels were off , they picked &quot; adorable , &quot; and when the labels were on , they picked &quot; ballet slippers . &quot;
i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff .
i mean , how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media ?
journalist : thank you very much indeed , mr. forrester and the mit lab .
to build that , what we &apos;d do with whirlwind technology is we &apos;d have to take up roughly from the 10 to mulholland , and from the 405 to la cienega just with those whirlwinds .
that &apos;s the way we get some of the magic into it , boys and girls .
mm : the global village is a world in which you don &apos;t necessarily have harmony . you have extreme concern with everybody else &apos;s business and much involvement in everybody else &apos;s life .
i think these ideas are difficult to understand , because when you &apos;re trapped in one paradigm , the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense .
by the way , speaking of the filing system , it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network .
ted turner : we did the work to build this , this cable industry , now the broadcasters want some of our money . i mean , it &apos;s ridiculous .
and it &apos;s no wonder that as we head into the writers &apos; strike , odd things happen .
and the head of marketing at nike says , &quot; people are coming to our site an average of three times a week . we don &apos;t have to go to them . &quot; which means television advertising is down 57 percent for nike .
rob forbes on ways of seeing
all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles , and where pedestrian areas -- and i came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic , and i &apos;m sure the skeptic eye would say , no , the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people can &apos;t afford cars , but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected .
just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture , and the way that the trees form vertical elements .
and cuba needs to be far more resourceful , because of the blockades and things , but a really wonderful playground .
and i thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements , it can do just about anything .
my measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks , but the fact that it performs a very important social function .
and of course , in a way , when i say romance , i mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation .
and when i was sitting in classes -- in which no one asked me to draw an airplane -- to my surprise .
all kinds of things .
so that if you sit down on my chair , whether you &apos;re five feet tall or six foot six , it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you don &apos;t have to look for something to adjust .
from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life .
just relieving your arms with armrests takes 20 percent of that load off .
while you &apos;re sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five-footer , or you can adjust it for the six-foot-six guy --
you might go to india , the far east .
interestingly , madeira first got the insect in 2005 , and here we are , a few years later , first cases of dengue .
it has to be safe .
now if that male is carrying a gene which causes the death of the offspring , then the offspring don &apos;t survive , and instead of having 500 mosquitos running around , you have none .
so we &apos;ve got that . you could call it a mosquito factory .
my train was a heart attack .
and where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot;
well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
we can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where paul has really spent a majority of his time .
that was what the conclusion of the dartmouth atlas of healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .

this is olusosun dump , the largest garbage dump in lagos , and 2,000 people work here , and i found this out from this fellow , andrew saboru .
so it &apos;s vast . but it should come with an asterisk , and the asterisk is that it excludes two thirds of the workers of the world .
they &apos;re going to eddy in lagos .
so this goes on in the formal economy as well as the informal economy , so it &apos;s wrong of us to blame — and i &apos;m not singling out siemens , i &apos;m saying everyone does it . okay ?
so , in all of these examples , structure is the determining force .
calculus is also a mathematics of curves . so , even a straight line , defined with calculus , is a curve .
so , it &apos;s tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel .
i got interested in them because they &apos;re the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the -- let &apos;s call it the decoration -- i know the frog doesn &apos;t think of it as decoration , but that &apos;s how it works -- are all intricately connected to one another .
the steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient , but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic .
but not always .
remember the second question that i raised at the outset was , how can we use this knowledge to make disease organisms evolve to be mild ?
some countries that might have clean water supplies , so that you can &apos;t get waterborne transmission : you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there .
they evolved to produce less toxin . and to just give you a sense of how important this might be , if we look in 1995 , we find that there &apos;s only one case of cholera , on average , reported from chile every two years .
whereas did ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem ?
so , if you were to mosquito proof houses , you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness .
but that &apos;s when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness .
and that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts .
and when they &apos;re missing , it &apos;s a barrier .
there &apos;s no other functions .
now you think , &quot; close hand , &quot; and a little section of your chest contracts .
there is not a learning process .
so one of the best parts of my job is working with really great patients who are also our research collaborators .
and we now have over 50 patients around the world who have had this surgery , including over a dozen of our wounded warriors in the u.s. armed services .
she &apos;s carrying all the weight through harnesses .
tk : that hand &apos;s not so good for clapping .
so rather than a super strong or super fast arm , we &apos;re making an arm that is -- we &apos;re starting with , the 25th percentile female -- that will have a hand that wraps around , opens all the way , two degrees of freedom in the wrist and an elbow .
yet what puzzled me most was celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial , yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed .
consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries .
her story has a positive ending , but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate .
and one of the major problems that we have is our operating system is not giving us the proper feedback .
and , more importantly , they &apos;re well-dressed .
where it &apos;s blue and it &apos;s green , it means the water is really cold .
and it &apos;s declined fairly substantially , about 21 percent since 1987 , when i started these surveys , in terms of number of active nests .
in some years , like this year , we found more than 80 percent of the adult penguins dead on the beach were covered in oil .
the same thing &apos;s true for penguins as well .
and you &apos;ll see soon that my graduate student ... and you see , turbo &apos;s pretty intent on his flipper patting .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
let &apos;s start with the world of 1945 .
because the people in the east , who never wanted to be there anyway , have gotten on those trains and roads and gone back to the west .
because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to undermine and change the way we think about political geography . so , the history of east asia in fact , people don &apos;t think about nations and borders .
china exports business people , nannies , students , teachers to teach chinese around the region , to intermarry and to occupy ever greater commanding heights of the economies .
no . it &apos;s the pipelines .
he purposely did not want these countries to make sense .
the more pipelines we have , the more silk roads we &apos;ll have , and the less of a dominant great game competition we &apos;ll have in the 21st century .
now let &apos;s look at turkey and the caucasus .
so denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller .
and if they exist and you can find them , then maybe one could eventually do something about it .
and if you look at the tissues of the animal , they &apos;re starting to deteriorate .
and the other part is on the inside where it sends signals into the cell .
and also , the common precursor also gave rise to people .
so foxo turns on a lot of genes .
but it &apos;s deteriorating .
and mutations that damage the tor gene -- just like the daf-2 mutations -- extend lifespan in worms and flies and mice .
there &apos;s a phenomenon which you have written about and spoken about , which is a negligible senescence .
mr : thank you very much indeed , cynthia kenyon .
whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice , dominating the visual and mental environment .
because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .
as long as we believe that people , our own neighbors , are selfish , stupid or lazy , then there &apos;s no hope .
but as there was still a dire shortage of donor organs , the gift of life was then extended from living , related donors to now living , unrelated donors .
and this inspired in my mind a shift from transplanting whole organs to perhaps transplanting cells .
earlier that week , i had taken a rather hard knock during late spring skiing -- yes , i fell .
and in the u.k. , neural stem cells to treat stroke are being investigated in a phase one trial .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
what are they doing right ?
one study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce .
that &apos;s right -- when you have a close couple friend split up , it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent .
and for the good of your relationships , i would encourage you to do the same .
somewhere , in a pattern like this , is you , your perceptions , your emotions , your memories , your plans for the future .
such an approach would literally , in a flash of light , overcome many of the obstacles to discovery .
it was done six or seven years ago by my then graduate student , susana lima .
the left and the right halves of the chamber are filled with two different odors , and a security camera watches as the flies pace up and down between them .
if you look first at the behavior of the fly on the right , you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber where the two odors meet , it marches straight through , as it did before .
i don &apos;t know about you , but i find it exhilarating to see how vague psychological notions evaporate and give rise to a physical , mechanistic understanding of the mind , even if it &apos;s the mind of the fly .
and we wondered how they use these bizarre toes to climb up a wall so quickly .
and you can try this in the lobby , and look at the gecko-inspired material .
it can also act as a counterbalance .
if you make it slip a huge amount , this is what we discovered .
so all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself .
it &apos;s unbelievable .
&lt; transcript &gt;
there &apos;s not a lot of science behind that one either .
so here &apos;s the thing . it sounds like a simple question .
and we drilled in the ross sea .
this sediment is 100 percent made up of the shells of microscopic plants .
and so , when a coral colony is killed by an el nino event , it leaves this indelible record .
i &apos;ll take you back here to the galapagos islands .
it &apos;s not just my group ; there &apos;s maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this .
so i &apos;ll close with a short discussion of ocean acidification .
you have to go back about 30 million years to find a time when co2 levels were double what they are today .
and a long time ago -- well , about 40 years ago -- my mom had an exchange student .
and i began to start teaching there .
how are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding
it made me sick to my stomach .
and i saw this with audiences . this woman came up to me after the screening and said , &quot; you know , i know this is crazy . i saw the bombs being loaded on the planes ; i saw the military going out to war .
and that you give israel an alibi to carry on ?
but after thinking logically about it , i didn &apos;t find any reason why not to meet them and let them know of our suffering .
i watched it and i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m blown away by it and its potential to bring voices from around the world , independent voices from around the world , and create a truly democratic , global television .
so what we &apos;d like to call this day of film is pangea cinema day .
even the earth warps space around it . now look at the moon . the moon is kept in orbit , according to these ideas , because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment that the sun and the moon and the earth can all create by virtue of their presence . we go to a full-frame view of this . the earth itself is kept in orbit because it rolls along a valley in the environment that &apos;s curved because of the sun &apos;s presence . that is this new idea about how gravity actually works . now , this idea was tested in 1919 through astronomical observations . it really works . it describes the data .
but if we zoom in and take the perspective of , say , a little ant walking around --
they have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus with neutrons and protons .
no , that &apos;s not one of the other predictions of string theory . but it raises the question : are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions , or do they tell us something about the world ?
when you swing your hand , you &apos;d be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again , but they &apos;re so small that we wouldn &apos;t know it .
that &apos;s the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out , if the extra dimensions are real .
really ? okay .
and now you see it .
we &apos;re very aware of this in the form of more cognitive attributes , like language .
your brain is learning . and it &apos;s learning that the right side of its visual field is under red illumination ; the left side of its visual field is under green illumination .
so you see it that way .
your brain doesn &apos;t know . because both are equally likely .
now remember -- -- she &apos;s supposed to be going to the blue flowers .
and now he &apos;s going to turn around , close his eyes , and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed .
now , some of you will notice that the consequence is that the light coming through those middle nine on the right , or your left , is exactly the same as the light coming through the middle nine on your right .
that might be true , but it &apos;s not terribly relevant .
most of the time , feeling and reality are the same .
when something is so common , it &apos;s no longer news -- car crashes , domestic violence -- those are the risks you worry about .
but if you know stuff , you &apos;re more likely to have your feelings match reality .
so this model is an intelligent representation of reality .
so models can change .
and when the vaccine appeared last winter , there were a lot of people -- a surprising number -- who refused to get it -- as a nice example of how people &apos;s feelings of security change , how their model changes , sort of wildly with no new information , with no new input .
new models that extend long periods of time are hard .
now , what we want is people to get familiar enough with better models -- have it reflected in their feelings -- to allow them to make security trade-offs .
those tamper-proof caps , that came from this .
just think for a moment .
this is a nuclear-proof facility .
and this is a distributed network .
some of these plants , like the ones on the bottom to the left of your screen , they are down to the last few remaining members .
some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
and it was very funny . i used four , five and six years old kids .
we are eating more marshmallows than we are producing .
they need political solutions .
we need military presence , but we need to move to politics .
the point is that we are probably seeing , for the first time in the history of the arab world , a revolution bottom-up -- people &apos;s revolution . social groups are taking to the streets .
and the paradox is that the decade before the last decade was so promising -- and for one reason primarily .
all of a sudden , ngos were not only standing in the streets , crying their slogans , but they were taking &#91; them &#93; into the negotiations , partly because they represented the victims of these weapons .
thank you for your attention .
so , some people are afraid of what i do .
the one on the page here is the same that &apos;s up there .
now , it &apos;s kind of nuts to work on a new nuclear reactor .
various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to --
is that you ? &quot; i said , &quot; well , you know , it &apos;s just a movie ! come on . &quot; so , the seti institute , with a little bit of help from me , and a lot of help from paul allen and a variety of other people , is building a dedicated radio telescope in hat creek , california , so they can do this seti work .
now , this is what tyrannosaurus rex looks like in my living room .
now , to a human audience , i need to explain that if penthouse magazine had a marine mammal edition , this would be the centerfold .
and the first story is called &quot; the faulty switch . &quot;
or the distant peel of thunder ?
and then back again .
the rest of the collection remains here , stored in plain brown paper bags until funds can be raised to build a permanent museum and study center .
and there probably are special cases of that .
you predict a black hole , and you look out the telescope and there it is , just like you said .
it requires hundreds of steps , and it takes a long , long time .
and i &apos;ll show you what that protein measurement looks like .
and you can see , mostly it overlaps and it &apos;s yellow , but there &apos;s some things that just alice has and some things that just bob has .
it &apos;s you ; you &apos;re broken .
and i &apos;m not saying you shouldn &apos;t mop up your water if you have cancer ,
because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong .
but they also talked about which candidate they were going to support .
you &apos;re all a member of tribes .
now , am i saying that in every department of motor vehicles across the land , you find a stage two culture ?
i happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book .
now , what &apos;s important to people at zappos , these may not be the things that are important to you .
saying , &quot; we &apos;re great &quot; -- that sounds pretty good .
and those are the ones that change the world .
see , people who build world-changing tribes do that .
and you don &apos;t leave them where they are . you nudge them forward .
and the going is pretty rough right now .
i &apos;m not sure if i can show you what tolerance looks like , but i can show you what compassion looks like -- because it is visible .
he &apos;s says that what they do with l &apos;arche is not a solution , but a sign .
he once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three-year-old .
einstein became a humanitarian , not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter , but because he was a jew as germany grew fascist .
but i recited a cheer . i recited a cheer along with everybody else .
now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is .
and they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community .
so , quite understandably , qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important .
and people would come from all over to hear him speak .
but we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work .
but what i &apos;d like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often .
now , i don &apos;t know how many of you have ever done that with your kids , but if you do , please trust me , it &apos;s the most pressure you can put on a child , to say -- -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing .
the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces .
so , there has not been a human-centric approach to addressing this segment of the market , so we really believe it is critical to think of it .
children dress with very colorful , colorful clothes , and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids , in a computer . and i have to tell you that it &apos;s so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids .
i don &apos;t think it &apos;s enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet , and look at numbers and say , yes , that &apos;s a good business .
this thing &apos;s selling still about a million copies a month .
there are secular kooks ; there are smart kooks , dumb kooks .
that &apos;s kind of a no-brainer .
this is why i believe what i believe . &quot;
it makes a difference what you believe .
it comes from serving .
and , by the way , your net worth is not the same thing as your self-worth .
ok . what &apos;s that all about ? well , i do know a couple of things .
what do you do with a shepherd &apos;s staff ?
that , to me , is what being purpose-driven is all about .
thank you .
before , they were closed off .
and by being a zero-dollar laptop , we can go to countries that can &apos;t afford it at all .
in fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
i &apos;ll give you an analogy .
you &apos;re all cfo , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
the first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
and so i &apos;m listening and i &apos;m listening , and at some point , i start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
so here we are again .
what happened in agriculture ? well , if you take agriculture over a century , agriculture in about 1900 would have been recognizable to somebody planting a thousand years earlier . yeah , the plows look different . the machines were tractors or stuff instead of mules , but the farmer would have understood : this is what the guy &apos;s doing , this is why he &apos;s doing it , this is where he &apos;s going . what really started to change in agriculture is when you started moving from this brute force engineering and chemistry into biology , and that &apos;s where you get your productivity increases . and as you do that stuff , here &apos;s what happens to productivity .
this is called coal bed methane . why is this picture interesting ? because if coal turns out to be concentrated plant life , the reason why you may get a differential in gas output between one mine and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up and another one may not blow up -- may be because there &apos;s stuff eating that stuff and producing gas .
when the dotcom bubble burst , hotelier chip conley went in search of a business model based on happiness . in an old friendship with an employee and in the wisdom of a buddhist king , he learned that success comes from what you count .
that very human lesson , more than 20 years ago , served me well during the last economic downturn we had .
so i realized in that dotcom crash that my role in life was to channel abe maslow .
i hate to argue with einstein , but if that which is most valuable in our life and our business actually can &apos;t be counted or valued , aren &apos;t we going to spend our lives just mired in measuring the mundane ?
we create the conditions for happiness to occur .
good question . but back to bhutan .
but all of those questions are tangible .
it &apos;s the intangible difference she makes during that one hour of work .
okay , one , two , three . audience : can you read this ?
your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information , and it gets ill .
so they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists .
dave strudwick : so what we &apos;re going to do — student : 5c .
the first author is blackawton primary school , because if it were ever referenced , it would be &quot; blackawton et al , &quot; and not one individual . so we submit it to a public access journal , and it says this . it said many things , but it said this .
now , science is about taking risks , so this is an incredible risk , right ?
&lt; / transcript &gt;
we actually get a chance to choose not to use products that have dangerous , poisonous plastic in them .
and it &apos;s going to wind up in a developing country -- often china .
you see , if you understand the link between what we &apos;re doing to poison and pollute the planet and what we &apos;re doing to poor people , you arrive at a very troubling , but also very helpful , insight : in order to trash the planet , you have to trash people .
well that insight of biomimicry , of our scientists finally realizing that we have as much to learn from other species . i don &apos;t mean taking a mouse and sticking it with stuff .
how can this movement be so passionate about saying we don &apos;t have throwaway stuff , no throwaway dead materials , and yet accept throwaway lives and throwaway communities like &quot; cancer alley ? &quot;
for a kid at that age , this was like infinite speed , disappearing , and i was very inspired by that .
on this next slide , is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure , because whether i give you a perfect skycar , the perfect vehicle for use , it &apos;s going to have very little value to you unless you &apos;ve got a system to use it in .
how would a trip in a skycar work ?
a vertical-takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system -- that &apos;s essential .
if one of those fails , you still have a second chance .
thank you .
do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff ?
and if you can bring another device close enough to the source , that will only work at exactly that frequency , you can actually get them to do what &apos;s called strongly couple , and transfer magnetic energy between them .
credit cards , robot vacuum cleaners .
so , i wanted to show you something .
&lt; transcript &gt;
i think there &apos;s a better solution .
it &apos;s covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores .
as we move to search , we rely on the relevance rankings , the web matching , the index crawling . but we want to use our brain !
we think a lot of good can come from this technology .
so here what we &apos;re trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-d model space .
this is the pudong area .
actually the country with more telephones is the soviet union , and the data referred to 1989 .
if i were to ask you , &quot; which are the two asian countries ?
so the east asian model has this massive selection bias -- it is known as selecting on a dependent variable , something we always tell our students to avoid .
so you have to always think carefully about these decisions .
statically , china is a one-party system , authoritarian -- there &apos;s no question about it .
comparing with a superstar is the wrong benchmark .
because , before the spread of coffee and tea through british culture , what people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank -- day-in and day-out , from dawn until dusk was alcohol .
all of these concepts , as kind of rhetorically florid as they are , share this basic assumption , which is that an idea is a single thing , it &apos;s something that happens often in a wonderful illuminating moment .
in the inside , it &apos;s all car parts .
and when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab , we have this image -- you know , they &apos;re pouring over the microscope , and they see something in the tissue sample .
now the challenge for all of us is : how do you create environments that allow these ideas to have this kind of long half-life , right ?
so they made it really easy to find it .
could you work on that problem ? &quot; and that &apos;s how gps was born .
so , to make a long story short , they came to canada .
so i presented those results at the international science fair , which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life .
we &apos;re removing the cancer cells , but we &apos;re revealing the previous damage that the body has tried to fix .
so i guess you could say that i &apos;ll probably be doing this for the rest of my life .
but it seems like by investigating , by attacking cancer , by searching where cancer is not , there has got to be something -- there &apos;s got to be something -- that &apos;s making this tissue resistant to tumors .
40,000 children all over asia .
and what struck me immediately was how in love the two of these people were .
this is on the way home .
and suddenly i was calling , saying &quot; i &apos;m in korea , and i &apos;ve met this extraordinary girl . &quot; and i said , &quot; the grandmother thinks she &apos;s sick , but i think maybe we would have to bring the grandmother over also . &quot; and i said , &quot; i &apos;ll pay for the ... &quot; i mean , i had this whole sort of picture .
and she said , &quot; he says he knows who you are , what do you want ? &quot;
and she said , &quot; well , he &apos;s saying , &apos; who the hell are you to walk into my house , some rich american with your cameras around your neck , accusing me of enslaving my niece ?
he actually agreed to the adoption .
we went back to our hotel room , and gene was showing natasha also where atlanta was .
and you know what kids are like when they &apos;ve been asleep for like an hour , it &apos;s like they took five valiums -- you know , they &apos;re all over the place .
and there , in the building were photographers waiting for people to jump .
and four months later , the adoption papers came through .
and seemed to be very popular very , very quickly .
this is sydney , who &apos;s going to be three years old in a couple of days .
dna analysis , one of the hallmarks of the scientific revolution of the last 400 years that he started , was the way we found which set of bones actually belonged to the person who read all those astronomical books which were filled with leftover hair that was copernicus &apos; hair -- obviously not many other people bothered to read these books later on .
it &apos;s actually mini-eclipses that occur when a planet passes in front of its star .
so now we have pluto to join the numbers of small planets .
but the statistical result is loud and clear .
and that &apos;s a very basic question , which we don &apos;t know the answer to , but which we can try -- and we are trying -- to answer in the lab .
and that deeper , underlying point is that science is in the process of redefining life as we know it .
okay , let &apos;s say this is the size of the observable universe , with all the galaxies , with all the stars , okay , from here to here .
hans rosling unveils new data visuals that untangle the complex risk factors of one of the world &apos;s deadliest diseases : hiv . he argues that preventing transmissions -- not drug treatments -- is the key to ending the epidemic .
and almost the same happens here .
you &apos;ll find the highest hiv rate in the world in african countries , and yet you &apos;ll find senegal , down here -- the same rate as united states .
i &apos;ve split kenya in its provinces .
and what is concurrency ?
and we also know that most of them were or are very poor -- did not live for very long .
about the same percentage of its population , and a really huge , nearly three-quarters share of global economic output .
not a big divergence in terms of uniform design for border guards admittedly , but in almost every other respect , it &apos;s a huge divergence .
one , competition .
that &apos;s the land grant on the bottom half of the slide .
any culture can get the work ethic if the institutions are there to create the incentive to work .
the first is , can you delete these apps , and are we in the process of doing so in the western world ?
no , we may hang on , despite the huge burdens of debt that we &apos;ve accumulated , despite the evidence that we &apos;ve lost our work ethic and other parts of our historical mojo .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
it doesn &apos;t take long from working with spiders to start noticing how essential silk is to just about every aspect of their life .
there &apos;s also aciniform silk , which is used to wrap prey .
this makes testing spider silk really , really easy to do in the laboratory , because we &apos;re actually , you know , testing it in air that &apos;s exactly the environment that spiders are using their silk proteins .
in fact , the toughest dragline in this survey is this one right here in this white region , a non orb-web-weaving spider .
clay shirky on institutions vs. collaboration
recently , flickr has added an additional function called tagging .
you notice we haven &apos;t got everybody who has a photo .
the photos are spread out over a longer period of time .
20 percent of the merchandise accounts for 80 percent of the revenue , 20 percent of the users use 80 percent of the resources -- this is the shape people are talking about when that happens .
most of the cooperative systems we &apos;ve seen haven &apos;t been around long enough to have gotten to the acceptance phase .
in the suburbanized , dual-income united states , stay-at-home moms are actually missing the social infrastructure that comes from extended family and local , small-scale neighborhoods .
so as much as we want the shield laws , the background -- the institution to which they were attached -- is becoming incoherent .
50 years in which loosely coordinated groups are going to be given increasingly high leverage , and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives -- like deciding in advance what &apos;s going to happen , or the profit motive -- the more leverage they &apos;ll get .
it &apos;s got germ . those are the good things , but those aren &apos;t the tastiest parts of the wheat .
and we &apos;re hoping that , sort of , the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough ,
and there &apos;s a short rest period . it can be for a few seconds .
and stage 11 , we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away .
but most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour .
enzymes are breaking forth sugars .
this is the product that everyone in the world eats , that is so difficult to give up .
thank you .
it &apos;s more interesting to me . it &apos;s less boring for me .
i get to write , sometimes for soloists and i get to work with one person , sometimes full orchestras , and i work with a lot of people , and this is probably the capacity , the role creatively for which i &apos;m probably best known professionally .
so in these two capacities , i &apos;ve been scavenger , in the sense of taking , like , the subway map , right , or thief maybe , and i &apos;ve also been designer , in the case of making the wristwatches .
so that gives you a little taste of that piece .
so how do we actually ask them the question ?
and how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
we have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
and it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the reverend thomas bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
it looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
ag : every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
and i think just the opposite is true .
it &apos;s like being in love in paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
so , he or she sits down , animates it , and tries to anticipate what &apos;s going to happen , and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game .
you hook these up -- in this case , to the virtual muscles of that two-legged creature here -- and hope that it does something interesting .
now , the interesting bit is , if i move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right , which is what i &apos;m doing now , here , it will fall over it in a completely different way .
what you see is it takes steps backwards , it tries to counter-balance , it tries to look at the place where it thinks it &apos;s going to land .
and that &apos;s our first product that we &apos;re going to release in a couple of weeks .
this is another behavior they requested .
for the first time , you &apos;ll have actors that really feel very interactive , that have real bodies that really react .
he &apos;s actually a better dancer than i am , i have to say .
you can draw , as everyone should .
you know the hindus are killing us muslims . be careful . &quot; i &apos;m like , &quot; dude , i &apos;m hindu . &quot; he &apos;s like , &quot; huh ! &quot; you know , my work is inspired by events such as this .
i &apos;ve called for tech support again .
ok , so why is the problem accelerating ? part of the problem is , ironically , because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use .
his computer had crashed , and he told the technician he couldn &apos;t restart it no matter how many times he typed 11 .
you &apos;ve obviously never opened all the toolbars , but all you have to type in is this little , teeny window down here .
there are 200 countries in the world . we like to think of the internet as a global village . i &apos;m sorry ; it &apos;s not one yet .
david pogue : yes , i do .
people are illuminating , putting manuals in the boxes .
this is a little company that &apos;s done very well with simplicity and elegance .
so the point is , this a really interesting story .
but i also , in looking at more powerful technologies and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging kind of digital technologies , became very concerned about the potential for abuse .
and so to limit the danger of these new things , we have to limit , ultimately , the ability of individuals to have access , essentially , to pandemic power .
the first is this whole area of education , and it really relates to what nicholas was talking about with a $ 100 computer .
if we take carbon nanotubes , you know , iijima discovered them in 1991 , they just have incredible properties .
the whole green dream -- because it can be profitable .
and the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic is about a factor of 1,000 in deaths and certainly enormous economic impact .
so we can design the future if we choose what kind of things we want to have happen and not have happen , and steer us to a lower-risk place .
and , as an outgrowth of all of this then , i wonder about whether we can , and whether we even should , think about transporting earth-type life to other planets .
so , back to mars .
so this is a very bold statement .
so , perspective is everything and , because of the history that i &apos;ve just briefly talked to you about , i have learned to think about earth as an extraterrestrial planet .
and yet , everything in this cave has adapted to it .
we know that on mars and the moon there are tons of these structures .
and so , that allows you the flexibility to go into very challenging terrain and actually make your way where you want to go .
imagine deciding right now that you &apos;re going to do it .
you can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgement brings ,
i think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world , must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world .
these white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles , this haunting , wonderful , nutty , mushroomy smell wafted up .
thank you .
there is now a toilet that has an mp3 player in it .
and , you know , when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;ve got a tasting coming up where we &apos;re going to serve the &apos; 47 cheval blanc . &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
and specifically , it &apos;s in terms of the very intense emotional rewards that playing games offers to people both individually and collectively .
let &apos;s say , for the sake of argument , my mission is to get 15 pies and i can get 15 pies by killing these cute , little monsters .
and each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item .
and everything comes towards that , and they watch it creeping up , and they own that as it goes along .
and two things really flow from this .
i mean , we &apos;re beginning to see some of the big problems around something like business are recycling and energy conservation .
and i got from global security policy to food because i realized when i &apos;m hungry , i &apos;m really pissed off ,
&quot; what are you doing for america &apos;s kids ? &quot;
so i went and stood on a big grain bin in the midwest ,
and instead of taking these two things as bifurcated problems that are very separate , it &apos;s really important to look at them as one system .
we all tend to think that these systems are quite different ,
i stayed thrilled until i got home ,
i know it &apos;s shocking , right , that architecture would actually say that .
and that &apos;s a project that is just about to open next week , the new home for the dallas theater center , the dee and charles wyly theatre .
but there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected .
i &apos;ll go through the three basic configurations .
here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium .
the theater has been going through its kind of paces .
at the eg conference in december 2007 , artist jonathan harris discusses his latest projects , which involve collecting stories : his own , strangers &apos; , and stories collected from the internet , including his amazing &quot; we feel fine . &quot;
and that suddenly , people , en masse , were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives .
this is showing the world &apos;s most common feelings overall right now , dominated by better , then bad , then good , then guilty , and so on .
and that water that you see there is the open lead , and through that lead , bowhead whales migrate north each springtime .
so , how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story ?
these whales are about 40 feet long , and weighing over 40 tons . and they provide the food source for the community for much of the year .
he was playing cops and robbers with his friends , running around town , and they all had plastic toy guns .
a 24-year-old road sweeper . i caught her on her lunch break .
and i said , &quot; you mean , like a cave ? &quot; and she said , &quot; yeah , like a cave . &quot;
jh : so if you caught that , she said she hoped to die when she was around 40 . that was enough life for her .
we &apos;ve got about a minute left .
the rigors of military medicine are not so dissimilar from the third world -- poor resources , a rigorous environment , a series of problems in lightweight , and things of this kind --
the brown color indicates the amount of glucose in the urine ,
and the most common of these is in a device that looks like the thing on the left .
that &apos;s on a piece of 8 by 12 paper .
he was telling the truth . because in a different culture , the dog is a surrogate for you , you know , &quot; today , &quot; &quot; this month , &quot; &quot; since the rainy season &quot; -- there are lots of opportunities for misunderstanding ,
so , my view of the health care worker of the future is not a doctor , but is an 18-year-old , otherwise unemployed , who has two things : he has a backpack full of these tests ,
and in this particular case we were just interested in the replicability of that .
we were very proud of this , particularly the title , which was &quot; eggbeater as centrifuge . &quot;
we all struggled for an entire day to think about simplicity .
that we responded in 2005 and 2006 with troop deployments , but we still didn &apos;t put enough troops on the ground .
and we had progress in the free media . we had progress in elections -- all of this with the so-called light footprint .
no , there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years .
you exaggerate your fears ,
bosnia and kosovo were signal successes , great successes .
why mountain rescue ?
and we are always being tempted up to our neck .
one exception is in massachusetts .
in deciding your vote for president today , was the race of the candidate a factor ?
and you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns .
affirmative action is not very popular frankly , with white voters , period .
but frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from nyu , have them go study for a semester at the university of arkansas , and vice versa . do it at the high school level .
if you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a caring doctor you can do some other things .
i never will forget it .
this country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
we have life imprisonment without parole for kids in this country .
we don &apos;t really know very much about it .
it would be unconscionable .
and ms. parks used to come back to montgomery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her dearest friends , these older women , johnnie carr who was the organizer of the montgomery bus boycott -- amazing african american woman -- and virginia durr , a white woman , whose husband , clifford durr , represented dr. king .
i think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a killer .
there was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduct in this county , it &apos;s all misconduct .
he kept pacing back and forth .
the great increase in mass incarceration in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categories .
unfortunately , it happens all the time .
she says , &quot; i did . &quot;
one was scratching at the end of the stick , another child listened at the other end .
the ipatient is getting wonderful care all across america .
but to her , it mattered deeply .
now if that were true , it &apos;s a true condemnation of our health care system , because they had been seen in other places .
and out of that sense of failure , i remember , i would always examine the patient .
i will never abandon you .
no , it -- well , it has kind of a right-leaning bias .
these -- they &apos;re just two different things .
this is a ufo shot from my house in altadena , california , looking down over pasadena .
this is the face on mars , which was -- in 1976 , where there was a whole movement to get nasa to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by martians .
virgin mary in clearwater , florida .
you can &apos;t miss it when i tell you what &apos;s there .

please close your eyes , and open your hands .
we needed something that was portable , something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra-low-cost , compared to the 20,000 dollars that an incubator in the u.s. costs .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
nathan was the number two person at the san francisco spca .
now there is a bunch of reasons for that , and stories about it .
if necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff .
you &apos;ve got people in white hats making food .
a thousand people who care enough that they will get you the next round and the next round and the next round .
hugo chavez did not invent the disaffected middle and lower class of venezuela . he merely led them .
she does it by telling a story to people who want to hear it .
but in case you do , here it is :
something that matters . start . do it . we need it .
♫ she was preserved by modesty of the religion ♫ ♫ she was adorned by the light of the quran ♫ shereen el feki : 4shbab has been dubbed islamic mtv .
we &apos;re not talking here about a clash of civilizations .
so i travel the globe , and what i &apos;m noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered , there seems to be a crisis of desire .
in love , we want to have , we want to know the beloved .
and then , more importantly , in this description about the other or myself -- it &apos;s the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire .
we are the only ones who have an erotic life , which means that it &apos;s sexuality transformed by the human imagination .
if everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses , we wouldn &apos;t be having such interesting talks about this .
on the other hand if you can &apos;t go , you can &apos;t have pleasure , you can &apos;t culminate , you don &apos;t have an orgasm , you don &apos;t get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own .
this is a song that was recorded there .
and the music there , i would say , the instruments , the intricate rhythms , the way it &apos;s played , the setting , the context , it &apos;s all perfect . it all works perfect .
people in the audience in these opera houses , when they were built , they used to yell out to one another .
it looks like bob dylan , but it &apos;s mahler .
he &apos;s whispering into your ears .
but now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
yeah . i think it &apos;s evolutionary .
i know that we &apos;re near the end of this conference , and some of you may be wondering why they have a speaker from the field of religion .
and in the course of one generation , israel was completely changed .
i would like to see oracle take up that , or some other technological geniuses work on this .
and it &apos;ll be on these questions : where did i come from ? why am i here ? where am i going ?
why do we suffer ? it &apos;s an age-old question that we haven &apos;t answered .
and yet , a few years earlier , death never crossed their mind .
he was astounded at the phenomenon we &apos;ve been considering : that people can achieve extraordinary heights in science , the arts and human enterprise , yet they also are full of anger , hypocrisy and have -- and self-hatreds .
i had to make that decision .
especially i will not die for you .
it preps you . it aims you .
before form i was storm , blind , ign &apos;ant -- still am .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
i wish to go with you .
in liberia , for example , the teenage pregnancy rate is three to every 10 girls .
i wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop . &quot; this is the dream of the african girl .
let &apos;s journey together . let &apos;s journey together .
but not only did they do that , they went to those who were running for seats to ask them , &quot; what is it that you will give the girls of this community when you win ? &quot; and one of the guys who already had a seat was very -- because liberia has one of the strongest rape laws , and he was one of those really fighting in parliament to overturn that law because he called it barbaric .
but the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance .
drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
so i joined a gym . &quot; now i don &apos;t mean to mock , but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn &apos;t more balanced ; it &apos;s more fit .
&lt; transcript &gt;
our 27 percent obesity rate is high , even for this country , and diabetes comes with it .
my dad was not alone .
physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety , the placement of the waste and other facilities , which , if done properly , don &apos;t compromise a community &apos;s quality of life .
we &apos;re at best ignored and maligned and abused , at worst , by negligent regulatory agencies , pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability .
there &apos;s enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable , community-friendly development can still make a fortune .
help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere .
the bubbles are the countries .
and this was 2007 .
and look here -- compare to the philippines of today .
that &apos;s the part where i sold the volvo and bought the toyota .
singapore is the best one .
this we can call dollar street .
that &apos;s when research functions in poor societies -- you must really live with the people .
it &apos;s this stupid concept of developing countries that puts us , argentina and mozambique together 50 years ago , and says that mozambique did worse .
economic growth to me , as a public-health professor , is the most important thing for development because it explains 80 percent of survival .
and remember , please remember my main message , which is this : the seemingly impossible is possible .
that every car you see out there is sculpted by hand .
it &apos;s that same kind of commitment , that same kind of beauty .
toothbrush , cool .
we start out with 10 cars ; we narrow it down to five cars , down to three cars , down to two cars , down to one car , and i &apos;m in the middle of that killing , basically .
so my concept of what a design studio was probably -- i wasn &apos;t up to speed on where these guys were .
you can probably remember tiburon , it used to look like this .
we put the car back at the center of our thoughts , and we put love , i think , truly back into the center of the process .
this information is also pretty staggering .
and the reason is that cancer , like every cell in the body , places little molecular bookmarks , that remind the cell &quot; i &apos;m cancer ; i should keep growing . &quot;
could we take this precious and rare cancerous material from this chest tube and drive it across town and put it into mice and try to do a clinical trial and stage it with a prototype drug ?
you might know that fat has memory .
now the business model involves all of you .
as a cosmologist , i want to ask , why is the universe like this ?
we would like to know what .
one of the people who did understand that this was a problem was richard feynman .
for one thing , the universe will expand forever .
it &apos;s very , very unlikely .
that will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven , and then making you an apple pie .
but even black holes don &apos;t last forever .
if that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bigger multiverse .
but well , i &apos;m feeling good right now .
a defense against hunger , which we were experiencing by that time .
we grew up interacting with the physical objects around us .
a message written on a sticky note to my mom on paper can come to an sms , or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar --
so , in order to realize this dream , i actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head .
thank you .
all the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera .
chris anderson : so , pranav , first of all , you &apos;re a genius .
ca : based on the people we &apos;ve seen at ted , i would say you &apos;re truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now .
taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease .
in fact , it goes against natural survival .
it is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from lascaux and chauvet .
by the end of the hand axe epic , homo sapiens -- as they were then called , finally -- were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by , who knows , telling jokes , storytelling , dancing , or hairstyling .
we decided to give it a try ,
so all this vast amount of information is then fed into the computer , and the computer can do two things .
so think of it as a monitor for the blind .
dh : so since we started this project , we &apos;ve been getting hundreds of letters , emails , phone calls from people from all around the world .
and what i &apos;ve spent 15 years doing in this business -- and it &apos;s taken me almost 14 to figure it out -- is i think about the future of wars in the context of everything else .
let &apos;s talk about a battle space . i don &apos;t know , taiwan straits 2025 .
this is not about overwhelming force , but proportional force .
we have a brilliant secretary of war .
they can indict your ass .
what do you get then ?
i &apos;m talking about regularizing it , making it transparent .
they spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world
everybody &apos;s got an opinion .
just be grateful robert reed didn &apos;t shove that bomb up his ass .
the rule is going to be this .
that &apos;s where the national guard &apos;s going to be .
the marines are like my west highland terrier .
see me now . don &apos;t talk about it later .
freeman dyson says : let &apos;s look for life in the outer solar system
if you look at the solar system , as we know it today , it has a few planets close to the sun . that &apos;s where we live .
and the step from the ocean to the land was not easy , but it happened .
so , the last thing i want to talk about is how to detect it .
we &apos;re having great difficulties at the moment and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck .
&lt; transcript &gt;
what i realized then is , they didn &apos;t really want to change the legacy stuff ; they didn &apos;t want to change the insides .
it allows the person to switch , and to mix these two colorations .
the packaging , and the website , and you need to continue to really touch the user , in many ways .
and at the time , i wasn &apos;t really working on computers .
it &apos;s a little bit like designing a fire hydrant , and it has to be easily serviceable : you have to know where it is and what it does .
i was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
thank you .
and for reasons equally unclear to me , seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us .
but barely six months into my new job , i met a woman who forced me to challenge all my assumptions .
she is on the taliban &apos;s hit list .
one father , who had initially balked at his daughter coming out in such a choir , now writes songs for them .
but no , for the protest , they dressed all in white , no makeup .
women like sakena and leah and layma have humbled me and changed me and made me realize that i should not be so quick to jump to assumptions of any kind .
it is in these little stories , these individual stories , that i see a radical epic being written by women around the world .
and i thought , &quot; well , sir , i am not a strategist , nor am i specialist . i am merely a storyteller . &quot;
and so the really cool bit is , the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer , and you download the blueprint , the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device .
there was no separation of sexes .
but still , if you &apos;re going to speak about a muslim culture , this has a core , the divine message , which began the religion , but then many traditions , perceptions , many practices were added on top of it .
and it is no secret that many islamic movements in the middle east tend to be authoritarian , and some of the so-called &quot; islamic regimes &quot; such as saudi arabia , iran and the worst case was the taliban in afghanistan -- they are pretty authoritarian . no doubt about that .
it &apos;s our faith , and we will be loyal to it .
and even the very extreme forms of islamism led to terrorism in the name of islam -- which is actually a practice that i think is against islam , but some , obviously , extremists did not think that way .
in 1950 , turkey had the first free and fair elections , which ended the more autocratic secular regime , which was the beginning of turkey .
and i believe that the islamic modernism which began in the 19th century , but which had a setback in the 20th century because of the political troubles of the muslim world , is having a rebirth .
the fire gave way , earth emerged -- but this was an alien planet .
lichens arose as a co-op . fungi married algae ...
when birds can &apos;t fly , they become vulnerable .
life is a force in its own right . it is a new element .
this quickly escalated into a five-day war between russia and georgia , leaving georgia ever more divided .
they exclude people that died as a consequence of civil war , from hunger or disease , for example . and they also do not properly account for civilian suffering more generally .
in all three cases , local leaders were willing and able to make peace , the international community stood ready to help them negotiate and implement an agreement , and the institutions have lived up to the promise that they held on the day they were agreed .
second , diplomacy .
i met benki three years ago in sao paulo when i &apos;d brought him and other leaders from indigenous peoples to meet with me and leaders from around the world , because we wanted to learn from each other .
he &apos;s created a cooperative to help people diversify their livelihoods .
why change ?
literature makes one sensitive , sensitive to people , to their dreams and to their ideas . &quot;
he &apos;s been a soldier , a teacher , a politician , a vice-mayor and a business man .
they &apos;ve gone away from what they did before , and they &apos;ve gone to something they didn &apos;t know .
the two brothers one day decided to go on a race , three times around the world .
india . indus .
and then he went to the top-most peak of the greatest mountain of the center of the world called meru .
which is right ?
sounds very much like the journey through the wilderness to the promised land , with the commandments held by the leader .
i love mythology too much .
so , how do you construct belief ?
because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence .
but that was interesting in itself . this is companies like vonage .
and it &apos;s so interesting that i thought i would tell you about it .
as i walk out of the house from my wi-fi hotspot into the cellular network on a call with my wife --
right ? nobody knows you &apos;re in pakistan .
so you get all of these really cool features -- like you can say , i want these people to be able to call me only during these hours . and i want these people to hear this greeting , &quot; hi boss , i &apos;m out making us both some money . leave a message . &quot;
yeah ! you &apos;re all trying to write this down .
dp : he &apos;s connecting me ! he doesn &apos;t even tell me the phone number .
they have 10,000 people who are being paid 20 cents per answer .
so now i &apos;m going to tell you how to get out of that .
i love my job .
dp : oh -- sorry i forgot .
i don &apos;t understand why we &apos;re not there yet .
ok , you tap , &quot; done &quot; and it will find out the song and play it for you .
just to round it up -- this is the new apple power music stand .
it &apos;s all the things a phone should be .
fortunately , her lump proved to be benign .
and breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense .
if we think about disruptive technology , we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive .
if you can find a tumor when it &apos;s less than a centimeter , survival exceeds 90 percent , but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases .
but with mbi , we use just light , pain-free compression .
and we &apos;re now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that &apos;s used in any other type of gamma technology .
of course we should .
one morning , in the year 1957 , the neurosurgeon walter penfield saw himself like this , a weird freak with huge hands , huge mouth , and a tiny bottom .
this is white noise .
and d.b. will probably roll toward you .
i just do that to make money .
thank you .
when i bring the 10 living and self-moving benches in the exhibition room , john was just beside me , and was like , &quot; hmm . hmm . &quot;
so let &apos;s have a look at your home .
no , not potatoes , but tomatoes , aromatic plants and so on .
damon horowitz calls for a &quot; moral operating system &quot;
when you come to my website , i actually know what you &apos;re going to do already because i &apos;ve seen you visit millions of websites before .
uh huh .
maybe we just follow our gut .
it &apos;s an objective truth about the form of two , the abstract form .
how about this : what if in any situation you could just calculate , look at the choices , measure out which one &apos;s better and know what to do ?
he has autonomy .
happily , we &apos;re not machines , and we can do it .
just a few days ago , right across the street from here , there was hundreds of people gathered together .
we figure out what will happen with this technology .
in the early &apos; 80s , some would say .
so what was it about crack cocaine ?
so he showed up at the university of chicago .
sudhir , on the other hand , got right back -- walked down to the housing project .
now , sudhir got to know very well the guy who had the unfortunate assignment of trying to take the iowa franchise .
it &apos;s easy to see , by the patterns of consumption they have .
now to give you a sense of just how bad the inner city was during crack -- and i &apos;m not really focusing on the negatives , but really , there &apos;s another story to tell you there -- if you look at the death rates -- just of random , young black males growing up in the inner city in the united states -- the death rates during crack were about one percent .
and really , they did all sorts of things to trick the young people into thinking what a great deal the gang was going to be .
but here &apos;s what he says about why they don &apos;t do that .
from regular , relative skydiving i went on to freeflying .
so with all this knowledge , i also wanted to get into stunts .
jc : yet . but people are trying . are you among those -- you &apos;re not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it ?
olafur eliasson : playing with space and light
and my idea was to make the space tangible .
the &quot; green river , &quot; as a kind of activist idea , not a part of an exhibition , it was really about showing people , in this city , as they walk by , that space has dimensions . a space has time .
i &apos;ve walked a lot in the mountains in iceland .
and suddenly it makes a difference in terms of making space accessible .
and this book was one of the most famous books in america for about 35 years .
he became a jesuit .
gradually , bringing it down , bringing it down . ♫ i want to thank you , thank you ♫ finger popping , ain &apos;t no stopping .
rather than revolution , we &apos;re much more interested in evolution ,
the first story starts last year when we went to shanghai to do the competition for the danish national pavilion for the world expo in 2010 .
unfortunately , mr. chen is now in prison for corruption .
this is how it looks today ; all traffic jam .
so the real mermaid , the real water , and the real bikes .
over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies that our client called the leonardo dicaprio balcony .
and all the rainwater that drops on the mountain is actually accumulated .
and our main idea was to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains of the topography of azerbaijan and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures , inhabitable of human life .
and i must say , before i go on , i should ask every one of you to try and get out pen and paper because i &apos;m actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that .
because we can &apos;t solve problems .
there are many , many things we can do out there , but we &apos;ve not had the prices , nor the sizes .
and what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list .
but it &apos;s saying that what we can do about it is very little , at a very high cost .
it might even cost up towards a percentage point of gdp every year for affected nations .
basically for the amount of money that we spend , we can do x amount of good in treatment , and 10 times as much good in prevention .
of course , that &apos;s mainly because climate change has good pictures .
they had all the same material but they could go vastly outside the scope of discussion , and they certainly did , to come up with their own lists .
they were still done when i was on sabbatical with my company in indonesia .
a fellow ted speaker , jonathan haidt , came up with this beautiful little analogy between the conscious and the unconscious mind .
one of them is to think without pressure .
designer suzanne lee shares her experiments in growing a kombucha-based material that can be used like fabric or vegetable leather to make clothing . the process is fascinating , the results are beautiful and the potential is simply stunning .
after about two to three weeks , we &apos;re looking at something which is about an inch in thickness .
possibly a good performance piece , but definitely not ideal for everyday wear .
it &apos;s absorbing my sweat , and it &apos;s feeding on it .
i told them that i studied and worked hard . if you tell them more , they won &apos;t understand anyway . &quot;
for example , i recently wrote an article in the new yorker magazine , but i can &apos;t afford to buy an ad in it .
in 1941 , the burnished patina of an all-american baseball glove inspired the founder of coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather .
but i &apos;m curious . if you had a minute , say , with apple &apos;s head of manufacturing , what would you say ?
i spent the year working with children who were training to become suicide bombers and with taliban recruiters , trying to understand how the taliban were converting these children into live ammunition and why these children were actively signing up to their cause .
then they ship them off , hundreds of miles away to hard-line schools that run along the taliban agenda .
they &apos;re ready to go out and fight because they &apos;ve been told that this is effectively their only way to glorify islam .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
but in the meantime i invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the saturnine system , and visit the enceladus interplanetary geyser park , just because we can .
a transcendent idea . it &apos;s a set of protocols that has changed everything from shopping to dating to revolutions . it was unequivocally not something a squirrel could chew on .
they stretch across the ocean . they &apos;re three or five
and he said there was coming soon , depending on the weather , but he &apos;d let me know when , and so with about four days notice , he said to go to this beach south of lisbon , and a little after 9 , this guy will walk out of the water .
lisa harouni : a primer on 3d printing
it &apos;s actually using a laser to fuse the new layer of material to the old layer .
typically , because we can create products very rapidly , it &apos;s been used by product designers , or anyone who wanted to prototype a product and very quickly create or reiterate a design .
and we &apos;re starting to see it being used for final end products .
we &apos;re all familiar with the idea of customization or personalization .
you can see , this came out of the machine in one piece and the electronics were inserted later .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
but he told me that after 9 / 11 , he began to have second thoughts .
and so there &apos;s now a lot of different violent jihads all over the world .
and then the taliban gave the keys of kandahar to osama bin laden . he made it our problem .
and perhaps , a time will come when they get the rightful credit for it .
&lt; transcript &gt;
my first dream was to be a doctor , and the second was to marry a good man who would stay with me and my family ,
so she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage -- of the total value , or about 400 dollars in savings .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
first , the coursework at caltech .
so i tried to figure out what other way could we try and make cost-effective solar electricity .
so for direct light , it takes only one bounce , for off-axis light it might take two , and for extreme off-axis , it might take three .
those were major breakthroughs .
but if your fuel source is free , then the only thing that matters is the up-front capital cost of the engine .
and then when the air comes back after it &apos;s been cooled it picks up that heat again .
these petals cost about a dollar each -- they &apos;re lightweight , injection molded plastic , aluminized .
this is how we envision it would be in a residential installation : you &apos;d probably have more than one unit on your roof .
and at less than a five-year payback , all of a sudden this becomes very economic
i &apos;d like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper .
but still , we look at the pieces .
and each one of the 11 chapters of the ipcc has six to ten subsections .
so i decided that i would start to draw . how hard could that be ?
but the painting reflects -- i don &apos;t think differently for children than i do for adults .
so it stayed in , and it was , and , you know , it was a good thing .
and basically , i was so , you know , it was so amusing , because i said , &quot; well , how much space do i have ? &quot;
so , &quot; my beautiful mother &apos;s family fled russia as well . too many pogroms .
a quote by bertrand russell , &quot; all the labor of all the ages , all the devotion , all the inspiration , all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction .
and then my aunt frances dies , and before she died , she tried to pay with sweet &apos;n low packets for her bagel .
i thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with .
td : so , even though i &apos;m somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world , still , i feel a sense of impediment , when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart , or a mind-to-mind , level .
and i think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us , but that , if we pay attention , we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take .
put them all together , and put all this under kind of natural selection , under mutation , and rewarded things for how well they can move forward .
but after a very short while , you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over .
eythor bender : we are ready with our industry partner to introduce this device , this new exoskeleton this year .
thank you .
it &apos;s one of the most lethal things we &apos;ve seen in circulation in the world in any recent centuries .
and in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets , we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu : seizures , central nervous system disorders , partial paralysis . this is not your normal garden-variety flu .
most of these people don &apos;t actually know what their job will be .
we have no uniform policies regarding quarantine across the united states .
there is some indication that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak .
the virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women
do you want to view the pandemic threat the way back in the 1950s people viewed the civil defense issue , and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu ?
to say ahh , if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic ?
i mean 100 percent death rate is pretty severe .
so we &apos;re going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response , stimulate the total cytokine cascade .
it &apos;s incredible just how light this thing is .
okay , i cheated , it was a mere 20 seconds .
but in america you have to explain . what are clubs ?
and i put the rope around and around and around and around and around till i had no more rope .
manhattan no longer spreads its infinity .
so you don &apos;t want me to street juggle here , right ?
so i start the walk . everything is fine .
for a moment , the entire crowd had forgotten their differences .
and dr. terry erwin , in 1983 , called the canopy , &quot; the last biotic frontier . &quot;
and so those epiphytes are actually paying the landlord a bit of rent in exchange for being supported high above the forest floor .
i know that as a scientist , i have information and as a human being , i can communicate with anybody , inside or outside of academia .
this experience of working with duke also led me to initiate a program called sound science .
our latest endeavor , with a grant from the department of corrections at washington state , they &apos;ve asked us to expand this program to three more prisons .
i had just returned from one of the deepest dives i &apos;d ever made at that time , -- a little over 200 feet --
scuba divers can &apos;t get there , submarines go right on past it .
it happens because there &apos;s too much concentration of oxygen in your body .
in 1994 , i was fortunate enough to get access to these prototype closed-circuit rebreathers .
but , if we only had an oxygen gas supply cylinder we wouldn &apos;t be able to go very deep , because we &apos;d run into oxygen toxicity very , very quickly .
now , as i showed you in the earlier diagram , these reefs that we dive on start out near the surface and they go almost vertically , completely straight down .
video : look at those ...
and this is my favorite line from the article .
well , it turns out this little white fish builds these giant mounds , one pebble at a time .
the survival of the species and survival of ourselves , because they &apos;re both about perpetuating the genome .
but here &apos;s what really perplexed me .
within a period of 60 days , his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words .
a film also exists in time ; it &apos;s an experience that you should go through emotionally .
think about that when you see that building , that sometimes the things we strive for so hard in life we never get to see finished .
nk : do you know anything about the architect ?
in social aspect of his life he was just like a child , he was not at all matured .
for many millennia , humans have been on a journey to find answers , answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence , about who we are and why we are , and of course , who else might be out there .
remember , one billion ?
so , ultimately what &apos;s going to determine the success or failure of seti is the longevity of technologies , and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos -- distance over space and distance over time .
occasionally , throughout history , this concept of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface , and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries .
so , what would change everything ?
so , in the opening days of 2009 , a visionary president stood on the steps of the u.s. capitol and said , &quot; we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass , that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve , that , as the world grows smaller , our common humanity shall reveal itself . &quot; so , i look forward to working with the ted community to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish , and in collaborating with you , hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality .
indeed , the researchers picked this site because ice and snow accumulates here 10 times faster than anywhere else in antarctica .
why do we need to study this anymore ?
thank you . &lt; / transcript &gt;
maybe a decade , according to my friends in detroit .
and protect another million jobs now at risk , mainly in auto-making .
because we all know the most about those ; probably everybody here drives one .
and the process needed to make it is actually coming toward the market quite nicely .
and that doesn &apos;t even count , for example , that available land in the dakotas can cost effectively make enough wind power to run every highway vehicle in the country .
the same for gps .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and at the end of those remarkable conversations with kids and their best friends across the united states , after two years , we pulled together some survey data from another 10,000 children , drew up a set up of what we thought were the key findings of our research , and spent another year transforming them into design heuristics , for designing computer-based products -- and , in fact , any kind of products -- for little girls , ages eight to 12 .
girl 1 : yeah , my character is usually a tomboy . hers is more into boys .
miko : i don &apos;t think so .
&quot; rockett 28 ! &quot; rockett : it &apos;s like i &apos;m just waking up , you know ?
now nobody believed him .
i &apos;m a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much ?
they believe mcdonald &apos;s food is tastier , and it leads them to experience it as tastier .
so capgras syndrome is a disorder where you get a specific delusion .
with my colleagues george newman and gil diesendruck , we &apos;ve looked to see what sort of factors , what sort of history , matters for the objects that people like .
this is a work by jackson pollock .
so she &apos;s stunned that he &apos;s standing in a subway station .
the most extreme example of this is that in some cases , pain under the right circumstances can transform into pleasure .
that &apos;s what happens in academic journals .
so , &quot; red wine can help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
it &apos;s very straightforward -- you take a bunch of people , you split them in half , you treat one group one way , you treat the other group the other way , and a little while later , you follow them up and see what happened to each of them .
and this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another .
10 years ago , history repeated itself , interestingly , when risperidone , which was the first of the new-generation antipscyhotic drugs , came off copyright , so anybody could make copies .
what you can see is , over on this side , the spurious false negatives , and over on this side , the spurious false positives .
this is a problem that is currently lacking a solution .
it all begins with empathy .
and before we know it , they send in the tanks and then send in the troops , and lots of people are dying , and it &apos;s a very , very difficult situation .
let me help you with some things that you might be thinking .
and you feel something about this .
but there &apos;s something else .
i mean this is serious . you &apos;re afraid .
you &apos;ve got to see this -- bible boot camp .
you &apos;re generalizing . it &apos;s wrong .
so it &apos;s all about coal , and the chinese are here in the united states .
are they brutal killers or patriotic defenders ?
and suddenly , without realizing it , you &apos;re seeing the world differently .
you know in 1950 the typical ship carried 5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods .
and i think , as you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s reasons for optimism ,
to put this differently : larger markets save lives .
now , today , less than one-tenth of one percent of the world &apos;s population are scientists and engineers .
that is something that we should embrace -- a wealthy china , a wealthy india , a wealthy africa .
here is gdp per capita from 1900 to 1929 .
so long as we hew to these two ideas : to keep globalizing world markets , keep extending cooperation across national boundaries , and keep investing in education .
my choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment that began with growing up on the gulf coast of alabama , on the florida peninsula .
consider the nematode roundworm , the most abundant of all animals .
as we move past the relatively gigantic mammals , birds , frogs and plants to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world enveloped and living within humanity ?
the hippo juggernaut we have created , if unabated , is destined -- according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research -- to reduce half of earth &apos;s still surviving animal and plant species to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century .
amateurs can do it also .
and it &apos;s not just our quality of life which suffers .
now , that &apos;s a little unfair . some of my best friends are architects . and they definitely do have ears .
add those up . that is a lot of children who are not receiving their education properly .
where are the office sound planners ?
i was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show , and began developing &quot; upwake . &quot; &quot; upwake &quot; tells the story of zero , a modern-day business man , going to work with his life in a suitcase , stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two .
three hundred and forty-four frames , four and a half years and commissions later , what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists .
i know theater unites us .
we teach , touch and move .
and it consists of seven chapters --
but i didn &apos;t want you to miss out on this one , because this , well , it &apos;s called &quot; portion-controlled meat cuts . &quot;
the low-tech bit is that it &apos;s literally a pig &apos;s heart valve mounted in the high-tech bit , which is a memory metal casing .
the world wide web , the french are told , ought to be referred to as &quot; la toile d &apos;araignee mondiale &quot; -- the global spider web -- recommendations that the french gaily ignore .
a handy thing to have , because language is infinite , and you can &apos;t just parrot back the sentences that you &apos;ve heard .
you may just be loud or obnoxious , or some other way causing them to have the headache .
second conclusion is that the ability to conceive of a given event in two different ways , such as &quot; cause something to go to someone &quot; and &quot; causing someone to have something , &quot; i think is a fundamental feature of human thought , and it &apos;s the basis for much human argumentation , in which people don &apos;t differ so much on the facts as on how they ought to be construed .
or if a dinner guest after the meal pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal , that would be rather awkward as well .
on the other hand , with indirect language , if you issue a veiled bribe , then the dishonest officer could interpret it as a bribe , in which case you get the payoff of going free . the honest officer can &apos;t hold you to it as being a bribe , and therefore , you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket .
but what i &apos;d like to talk about today is what life might teach us in technology and in design .
and i said , well , in the same way that they exude a protein and it starts the crystallization -- and then they all sort of leaned in -- they let go of a protein that stops the crystallization .
and there &apos;s a lot of cool technologies out there that life has .
back to that shell : the shell is a self-assembling material .
we see it that way . plants are busy making long chains of starches and glucose , right , out of co2 . he &apos;s found a way -- he &apos;s found a catalyst -- and he &apos;s found a way to take co2 and make it into polycarbonates . biodegradable plastics out of co2 -- how plant-like .
what if we were to separate out metals from waste streams , small amounts of metals in water ? that &apos;s what microbes do ; they chelate metals out of water .
luckily , there are millions and millions of geniuses willing to gift us with their best ideas .
this is the simple design brief . i mean , it looks simple because the system , over 3.8 billion years , has worked this out .
and if you &apos;re talking about entrepreneurs in conflict and post-conflict settings , then you must talk about women , because they are the population you have left .
and when this story posted , i ran to my computer to send it to the imf official .
she had come seeking serious investment dollars so that she could build the factory and buy the equipment she needs to export her chocolates to africa , europe , the middle east and far beyond -- capital that would help her to employ more than the 20 people that she already has working for her , and capital that would fuel her own country &apos;s economic climb .
and when we talk about women , they are either exceptions to be dismissed or aberrations to be ignored .
i would love to share with you a story .
they realized that , in 6,000 years of storytelling , they &apos;ve gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting shakespeare on facebook walls .
but what about a recycled paper towel that comes in those little half sheets ?
and so this is framing -- lumber , composite materials --
on the scale of my portion of the house , this is equivalent to about as much as i drive in a year , it &apos;s about five times as much as if i went entirely vegetarian .
and in return , we just tried to kill them all the time .
but she did it all on her own .
wait for the light to stop the traffic .
and crows eventually come by , and eat the peanuts
they figure it &apos;s gotta have more to it .
you know , he was &quot; born in 1912 , the year the titanic sank , greatest ship every built . hits the tip of an iceberg , and bam , it went down . it went down and i came up . wow , some century . &quot;
i say , &apos; thank god for a human reaction , we haven &apos;t lost yet . &apos;
so , talk about risk taking . i &apos;m going to do somebody that nobody likes .
i &apos;m just talking about the particular night that she died .
&quot; and then we got the baby and my other child , and we drove out to , like , i-95 .
but at the end of &apos; 92 , when we were in such turmoil , and having all the financial problems , and all the mental problems , i began to really realize that koreans are completely left out of this society and we are nothing .
igniting , igniting , igniting fire . igniting fire .
you know , if i wasn &apos;t talking -- you know , like , you know , she wanted me to talk , i don &apos;t think she would even come out here . &apos;
&lt; / transcript &gt;
i &apos;ll get an esl class in chinatown learning &quot; it &apos;s raining , it &apos;s pouring . &quot;
everybody gets heard .
now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways --
but they &apos;re having a hard time doing it because they &apos;re still trying to use demographics in order to understand them , because that &apos;s how ad rates are still determined .
and i think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere .
bear in mind this was an ultrasound ,
and i said , &quot; so , could you do it right here ? &quot;
but it would be an orgasm --
if you go all the way back to hippocrates , physicians believed that orgasm in women was not just helpful for conception , but necessary .
there &apos;s another way that orgasm might boost fertility .
and the happy result .
from arousal , all the way through orgasm , in men and women --
which is my second favorite line in the entire oeuvre of alfred kinsey .
but after having lost a beloved teacher in 2006 and a good friend last year to suicide , and sitting last year at tedactive , i knew that i needed to step out of my silence and past my taboos to talk about an idea worth spreading -- and that is that people who have made the difficult choice to come back to life need more resources and need our help .
as it turns out , there &apos;s a strong form and a weak form of this knot , and we were taught to tie the weak form . and here &apos;s how to tell .
the materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call frubber , and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen .
so , we &apos;ve made 20 robots in the last eight years , during the course of getting my ph.d .
what you &apos;re doing , right now , at this very moment , is killing you .
you &apos;ll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas .
while i was pondering this question , i came across this urban legend about ernest hemingway , who allegedly said that these six words here : &quot; for sale : baby shoes , never worn , &quot; were the best novel he had ever written .
i guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks .
or the recipe for the ultimate jaw-dropping tedtalk : &quot; flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer . &quot;
and yet , speculative though the idea surely is , i aim to convince you that there &apos;s reason for taking it seriously , as it just might be right .
because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space -- we now call it dark energy , but i &apos;ve made it smokey white here so you can see it -- its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other , driving expansion to speed up , not slow down .
and you can think about those as height , width and depth .
it &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measured instead of any of the other possibilities and that &apos;s a question on which we can make headway .
because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the big bang .
the light those galaxies emit , even traveling at the fastest speed , the speed of light , will not be able to overcome the ever-widening gulf between us .
so on the one hand , it &apos;s just incredible where we &apos;ve gotten , but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future .
he was quite a know-it-all , and he wanted to kind of make you laugh .
he &apos;s now going to use the other thing which is essential , and that &apos;s his voice .
we &apos;re actually teaching him .
milo &apos;s mom : oh , you &apos;ve got gravy all over the floor .
and i promise you , if you &apos;re sitting in front of this screen , that is a truly wonderful moment .
i &apos;m going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the admonition , be perfect .
i gave her medications that we call diuretics , water pills , to get her to pee out the access fluid .
the three words are : do you remember ? &quot; do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot; the other nurse asked matter-of-factly .
it &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and i went through the same period of shame and recriminations and felt cleansed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
and it &apos;s almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person .
they want to be able to say , &quot; look , don &apos;t make the same mistake i did . &quot;
your life as you know it goes into suspended animation .
it was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war , humanitarian aid workers , and of course the brave and courageous people of sarajevo themselves .
when i go back to syria , next week in fact , what i see is incredibly heroic people , some of them fighting for democracy , for things we take for granted every single day .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and you have a scheme here that describes how it works .
she can scratch her back , she can scratch one of us , she can play another game .
and by the way , they don &apos;t read english anyway , so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position .
although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements , they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord .
and this leads to the wonderful irony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating .
sure enough , their tools were more complicated than those of homo erectus , but they too showed very little change over the 300,000 years or so that those species , the neanderthals , lived in eurasia .
and so some time around 200,000 years ago , our species confronted this crisis .
but he looks at the pile of arrowheads , thinks they &apos;re a gift , picks them up , smiles and walks off .
if we go to the island of papua new guinea , we can find about 800 to 1,000 distinct human languages , different human languages , spoken on that island alone .
if 27 individuals from those 27 member states sat around table , speaking their 23 languages , some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of 253 translators to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities .
what we know about this foxp2 and neanderthals is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths -- who knows .
why would we waste this money on you ? &quot; this is what happens to girls in remote areas .
and that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity .
the second tenet of &quot; half the sky &quot; is that , let &apos;s put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all ,
i would say , on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking .
the villagers thought she was cursed ; they didn &apos;t know what to do with her .
at the time , there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a 65-dollar loan .
no matter , she was just delighted to be in school .
i will just leave you with two things .
it says all the same stuff as all the other ones you &apos;ve seen .
cheap meaning a few percent of gdp .
the result of that was pretty dramatic .
ken went and ran his models , and found that it did .
the other problem is they &apos;re right in the ozone layer , and i &apos;d prefer them above the ozone layer .
this improved science and engineering will , whether we like it or not , give us more and more leverage to affect the planet ,
so here &apos;s one way to think about it , which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it &apos;s cheaper .
we might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain and morally unhappy , that it &apos;s a lot better than not geo-engineering .
right now we may think of a big , rich country like the u.s. doing this .
and it &apos;s just another place from which to observe , and the understanding that there are no absolute , all-knowing insiders . and the outsider can never really reach the core .
and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror .
they carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations ,
they flip the negative .
i traveled across the united states photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit , violent crimes .
so photographing there , i was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction , in both his life and in photography .
and it reiterates that distortion is a constant , and our eyes are easily deceived .
there is a rash of suicide in china .
we tend to think of emotions as just feelings .
they like to listen to consonant melodies instead of dissonant melodies .
and we see here the smile .
the other thing is , that a piece of evidence is , is if you look at computerized text analysis of people who commit suicide , what you find there , and it &apos;s quite interesting , is use of the first person singular -- &quot; i , &quot; &quot; me , &quot; &quot; my , &quot; not &quot; we &quot; and &quot; us &quot; -- and the letters are less hopeless than they are really alone .
you see mental distress going up with lower income .
i &apos;m here today to share with you an extraordinary journey -- extraordinarily rewarding journey , actually -- which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis .
it scratches on the soil .
there &apos;s a number of mines placed blindly ,
and even in hiv-positives , it makes sense .
so this is really considerable .
it can contemplate the meaning of infinity , ask questions about the meaning of its own existence , about the nature of god .
it &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person &apos;s action .
but the same neuron , in some cases , will fire when i simply watch another person being touched .
so , you have a patient with a phantom limb . if the arm has been removed and you have a phantom , and you watch somebody else being touched , you feel it in your phantom .
here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen .
remember , that thing is just about 30 micrometers across .
this is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt , similar to the one that i &apos;m wearing now .
because the personal , as you know , is political .
i &apos;m going to tell you why .
doctor healy then subsequently became the first female director of our national institutes of health .
and we said , &quot; we &apos;re going to hypothesize that the fatty plaque in women is actually probably different , and deposited differently , than men . &quot;
and if you look carefully , you can see that there &apos;s a black blush right there .
these are female and male stem cells .
women have heard the call for breast cancer and they have come out for awareness campaigns .
here &apos;s our living room , the baby bedroom , kitchen , dining room and the rest of the house .
dr : he sure nailed it , didn &apos;t he .
this is a moment , one moment captured across multiple cameras .
we call these wordscapes .
you have the event structure , the common ground that the words are about , coming out of the television feeds ;
that drives tune-in behavior back into mass media , and you have these cycles that drive the overall behavior .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is powerful stuff . &quot;
information designer tom wujec talks through three areas of the brain that help us understand words , images , feelings , connections . in this short talk from tedu , he asks : how can we best engage our brains to help us better understand big ideas ?
and this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .
so the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning .
and this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible .
everything in the kitchen was salvaged .
so we changed that and put , &quot; this is the famous budweiser house .
in order to do what i do , you have to understand what causes waste in the building industry .
we &apos;ll go , &quot; ooh , that &apos;s nice . &quot;
and they &apos;re doing a pretty good job there in the forest , working all the byproduct of their industry -- with osb and particle board and so forth and so on -- but it does no good to be responsible at the point of harvest in the forest if consumers are wasting the harvest at the point of consumption , and that &apos;s what &apos;s happening .
he said that we have in our noggin the perfect idea of what we want , and we force environmental resources to accommodate that . so we all have in our head the perfect house , the american dream , which is a house , the dream house .
all we have to do is look at what one company did with carbonated prune juice .
that exacerbates and continues this model .
i fail all the time , every day ,
everyone i met , i felt i knew them for as long as i could remember .
the show began with tremendous special effects , because there were catastrophic climate shifts -- which sort of sounds interesting as a parallel to today .
and here are some of the other categories , if you look at the whole planet .
and with all the internal regulators of my brain damaged , i felt everything simultaneously .
i &apos;m not a doctor , so i &apos;m not going to talk about the various subtests .
but that person could be identified as having a learning disability .
if that some place else where it bulges is inside the biggest nerve in your body , your brain , you get a vascular migraine .
and other fm devices implanted in fingertips , on contacting a surface , will send a message back to the sensory cortex of the brain , so that the person feels a sense of touch .
and then i was amazed at what role technology played in your recovery .
but there &apos;s millions of deaf people in the world , and the cochlear implant has given hearing to thousands of deaf people now .
and one of the questions from which i learned a lot was this one : &quot; which country has the highest child mortality of these five pairs ? &quot;
and 1962 , there was really a group of countries here that was industrialized countries , and they had small families and long lives .
and if we look where the income ends up -- the income --
they could sell their textiles -- on equal terms as the people in europe and north america .
you have to invest in health . you have to get kids into schooling .
a search function where we can copy the data up to a searchable format and get it out in the world . and what do we hear when we go around ?
i end now with the world . there , the internet is coming .
and thought i would end up , you know , if i was bright enough , maybe getting a ph.d. from cornell in ornithology .
so i wanted to work with him , but he didn &apos;t want a former birdwatcher , and i ended up in cambridge , england .
you know , basically , reading is a good thing ; you get facts .
she was a crystallographer .
most scientists are really rather dull .
and that let marshall nirenberg , you know , take rna -- synthetic rna -- put it in a system making protein . he made polyphenylalanine , polyphenylalanine . so that &apos;s the first cracking of the genetic code , and it was all over by 1966 .
you aren &apos;t treated if it &apos;s not dangerous .
were they crazy also , and we didn &apos;t know it ?
so we had a dance , and girls and their fathers came in multitudes .
the fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection , something that a lot of them didn &apos;t even have for a while .
but i &apos;m also sure , pretty sure , that absolutely nobody is thinking of this .
bruce aylward : oops . jon , polio &apos;s almost been eradicated .
we &apos;re not trying to get it down to just a few cases , because this disease is like a root fire ; it can explode again if you don &apos;t snuff it out completely .
and there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries .
this is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years .
these are children like umar .
this is the kind of commitment now we &apos;re seeing to try and reach all of the children we &apos;ve been missing .
and in the last six months , we &apos;ve had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history .
but the interesting thing is , of those three , india &apos;s looking real good , as you just saw in the data .
&lt; transcript &gt;
so we felt that that day was the day that she really earned her name .
dj : and of course , one of the rules that we have in the vehicle is that he who drowns the vehicle gets to swim with the crocodiles .
dj : the amazing thing about these moments -- and this is probably a highlight of our career -- is that you never know how it &apos;s going to end .
but nothing prepared us for what happened next in our relationship with her , when she started hunting .
we had to deal with them with respect and celebrate them .
and that &apos;s probably because we haven &apos;t seen it like we are today .
biologist richard dawkins makes a case for &quot; thinking the improbable &quot; by looking at how the human frame of reference limits our understanding of the universe .
&quot; tell me , &quot; he asked a friend , &quot; why do people always say , it was natural for man to assume that the sun went round the earth rather than that the earth was rotating ? &quot;
unaided human intuition schooled in middle world finds it hard to believe galileo when he tells us a heavy object and a light object , air friction aside , would hit the ground at the same instant .
if a neutrino had a brain , which it evolved in neutrino-sized ancestors , it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space .
middle world -- the range of sizes and speeds which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with -- is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum that we see as light of various colors .
i wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand , say , quantum theory , if we brought up children to play computer games , beginning in early childhood , which had a sort of make-believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen , a world in which the strange goings on of quantum mechanics were enlarged by the computer &apos;s make-believe , so that they became familiar on the middle-world scale of the stream .
one of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature , and trying to find hidden data within nature .
we can also use cymatics for healing and education .
we can inspire each other .
but the one that &apos;s really been sort of stressing me out , that i haven &apos;t been able to figure out , is this phrase &quot; cala a boca , galvao . &quot;
and the first lesson , which i think is a worthwhile one , is that you cannot go wrong asking people to be active online , so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase .
we end up within these filter bubbles , as my friend eli pariser calls them , where we see the people we already know and the people who are similar to the people we already know .
two hops , you &apos;re in suva , the capitol of fiji .
and before you conclude that this is just a function of american tv news -- which is dreadful , and i agree that it &apos;s dreadful -- i &apos;ve been mapping elite media like the new york times , and i get the same thing .
we started in 2004 .
there &apos;s a group right now in china called yeeyan . and yeeyan is a group of 150,000 volunteers who get online every day .
i don &apos;t think this is necessarily an algorithmic process .
dhani has a television show . it &apos;s called &quot; dhani tackles the globe . &quot;
and it &apos;s not completely gratuitous , because wok and roll -- chinese food and japanese foods , so it kind of works out .
well , the short answer is , we locked up all the japanese during world war ii , including those that made fortune cookies , so that &apos;s the time when the chinese moved in , kind of saw a market opportunity and took over .
showed them all the pictures of general tso chicken that i showed you , and they &apos;re like , we don &apos;t know this dish .
and another way that you saw , sort of , this sort of , this antipathy towards the chinese is through documents like this .
and even the brits have their own version .
so , it wasn &apos;t until the first guy shows up the next day , and they ask him , &quot; where did you get your number from ? &quot;
i was really surprised to discover that , not only in philadelphia , but also in atlanta , because what had happened was that a chinese family had moved from atlanta to -- sorry , from philadelphia to atlanta , and brought that with them .
and then , we fast-forward to about 1932 , when three italian psychiatrists , who were largely treating depression , began to notice among their patients , who were also epileptics , that if they had an epileptic -- a series of epileptic fits , a lot of them in a row -- the depression would very frequently lift .
so people would have a real grand mal seizure .
well , you &apos;re in a university medical center , where everybody knows everybody , and it &apos;s perfectly clear to my colleagues , so my referrals began to decrease .
remember when you were a kid , and you had to step on every line ?
and he went back to them , and they agreed to do another 10 .
it &apos;s been , as i said , close to 30 years .
there is recovery .
they knew that about 75,000 hondurans every year would leave to go to the united states , and they wanted to ask , what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do the same things in honduras .
this airport alone covers more than 100 square kilometers .
they &apos;ve actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third .
so , you &apos;re calling for a global ethic .
there is a great story , again , told about richard nixon .
you have time to alert one house . what do you do ?
then the question is , how do you make that change happen ?
so , while i can &apos;t automatically say that britain will rush to the aid of any citizen of any country , in danger , i can say that britain is in a position where we &apos;re working with other countries so that this idea that you have a responsibility to protect people who are victims of either genocide or humanitarian attack , is something that is accepted by the whole world .
and i do believe that there is a strong possibility that if we work together , we can get that agreement to copenhagen .
thank you .
and so we get this starting material .
you can add a third dimensionality to the film .
so , much like you &apos;re seen at night by a car , then the idea is that you can see , if you illuminate tissue , you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk .
and so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you &apos;ve seen .
it knows how much it &apos;s moving .
ever see that little swiss army knife they have to fight with ?
so thank you all for being a part of it .
and , of course , he never talked about his past life when he was a forger .
my father , a secret agent ?
it was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .
this sense of responsibility for other people &apos;s lives when he was just 17 -- and also his guilt for being a survivor , since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not -- stayed with him all his life .
after the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to palestine before the creation of israel .
with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles .
it &apos;s a very important period --
you can take virtually any parameter that matters for human well-being -- nitrous oxide , methane , deforestation , overfishing land degredation , loss of species -- they all show the same pattern over the past 200 years .
now we to ask ourselves : which are the large environmental processes that we have to be stewards of to keep ourselves safe in the holocene ?
well , there &apos;s no science to suggest . in fact , there is ample science to indicate that we can do this transformative change , that we have the ability to now move into a new innovative , a transformative gear , across scales .
we cannot continue consuming water as we do today , with 25 percent of world rivers not even reaching the ocean .
and i only have 15 minutes , and i see they &apos;re counting already .
and also -- advertising people do that all the time -- -- and i -- well , what happened is when i went back , it was on the way back to my car , the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun -- i don &apos;t know why he had a gun -- and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor .
the bonsai table .
it had a physicality , and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative that goes this way , towards the image . so this is &quot; monkey with leica . &quot;
so they &apos;re called &quot; pictures of chocolate . &quot;
and i felt that i would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself .
my time is nearly up .
and they are around three billion such letters long .
perhaps the biggest difference most of us would imagine existed .
you have to work very carefully to avoid contamination of experiments with dna from yourself .
so we can then ask for denisovans the same things as for the neanderthals : did they mix with ancestors of present day people ?
the brilliant playwright , adrienne kennedy , wrote a volume called &quot; people who led to my plays . &quot; and if i were to write a volume , it would be called , &quot; artists who have led my exhibitions &quot; because my work , in understanding art and in understanding culture , has come by following artists , by looking at what artists mean and what they do and who they are .
this is harlem , actually , on january 20th , thinking about itself in a very wonderful way . so i work now at the studio museum in harlem , thinking about exhibitions there , thinking about what it means to discover art &apos;s possibility .
i am always amazed by the way in which artists are willing to do that in their work .
it was a routine training jump , like many more i &apos;d done since i became a paratrooper 27 years before .
if you &apos;re an inboard personnel , stand up .
you can &apos;t delay that much .
and i also was raised with personal examples of leadership .
a 22-year-old individual operating alone , thousands of miles from me , has got to communicate to me with confidence .
and yet , we need to have that shared sense .
and every morning in the ranger regiment , every ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them -- says a six-stanza ranger creed .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
many of the solutions that i and my colleagues seek out and write up every day have some important aspects in common : transparency , collaboration , a willingness to experiment , and an appreciation of science -- or , more appropriately , science !
in kenya , mobile phone minutes have actually become an alternative currency .
camera phones , of course , would be fundamental to the project .
it would be a collaborative , bottom-up approach to environmental awareness and protection , able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way -- and if you need greater sensor density , just have more people show up .
i started in 1999 to try and address this problem with an experiment , which was a very simple experiment in new delhi .
in other words , they were all speaking like james tooley .
i mean , if there &apos;s stuff on google , why would you need to stuff it into your head ?
so a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says , literally , &quot; apart from the fact that improper replication of the dna molecule causes genetic disease , we &apos;ve understood nothing else . &quot;
so i came back to newcastle with these results and decided that there was something happening here that definitely was getting very serious .
there was photographic recall inside the children ,
they &apos;re called soles : self organized learning environments .
a self-organizing system is one where a structure appears without explicit intervention from the outside .
and it was really the beginning of my understanding the power of language , and how what we call people so often distances us from them , and makes them little .
and it taught me three lessons that i think are so important for us today , and certainly in the work that i do .
it &apos;s indigenous to china and the far east , but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in africa , patrick and his colleagues said , &quot; let &apos;s bring it here , because it &apos;s a high value-add product . &quot;
unicef came forward and said , &quot; we &apos;ll buy most of the nets , and then we &apos;ll give them away , as part of the global fund &apos;s and the u.n. &apos; s commitment to pregnant women and children , for free . &quot;
so then , from a policy perspective , when you start with the market , we have a choice .
i &apos;m going to be talking a little bit about music , machines and life .
so we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using , divided between two floors .
and it &apos;s actually in the machine .
so you put that up front so that , if it fails , at least you know you don &apos;t have to reset the whole thing .
&lt; transcript &gt;
out of them : brain , heart , liver , you get the picture , but out of your cells .
because imagine if you ever get that call that gives you that bad news that you might have cancer .
and this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we , humans , are in charge of life on earth ; we &apos;re like the capricious gods of old greek myths , kind of playing with life -- and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it .
vehicles of all different kinds , usually with some electronics or electric power systems in them . i find they &apos;re all the same ,
for those who live on the mainland , it was tough being away from home .
ok .
the one final bit of sparkle we &apos;ll put in at the very end here is an utterly impractical flight vehicle , which is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that -- rubber-band powered -- that we &apos;ll show you .
a marsupial is a mammal with a pouch like a kangaroo .
and yet , she was feeding three little baby tasmanian devils in her pouch .
and the answer came from studying the tasmanian devil cancer &apos;s dna .
it &apos;s not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it .
and this is a photograph of dr. southam in 1957 injecting cancer into a volunteer , who in this case was an inmate in ohio state penitentiary .
well , the conventional approach to post-conflict situations has rested on , on kind of , three principles .
why does the politics get easier ?
post-conflict economic recovery is a slow process .
so that &apos;s idea one :
governments in post-conflict situation often respond by puffing up the civil service .
we need firms . the firms have gone away .
they would be co-branded as being done by the post-conflict government , in the country .
where would that leave us ?
now , anybody has that capacity , which previously was restricted by price just to a few actors . if they have the price of entry into an internet cafe -- the last time i looked , it was something like a pound an hour -- and if you have skype , it &apos;s free .
indeed , if you can learn to use more soft power , you can save a lot on carrots and sticks .
so we &apos;ve got , what , 17 more years to go or so before china &apos;s bigger .
the answer is it matters quite a lot .
the bottom board of this three-dimensional , the board of transnational relations , things that cross borders outside the control of governments , things like climate change , drug trade , financial flows , pandemics , all these things that cross borders outside the control of governments , there nobody &apos;s in charge .
so if one looks at the statements that have been made about this , i am impressed that when hillary clinton described the foreign policy of the obama administration , she said that the foreign policy of the obama administration was going to be smart power , as she put it , &quot; using all the tools in our foreign policy tool box . &quot; and if we &apos;re going to deal with these two great power shifts that i &apos;ve described , the power shift represented by transition among states , the power shift represented by diffusion of power away from all states , we &apos;re going to have to develop a new narrative of power in which we combine hard and soft power into strategies of smart power .
s : i don &apos;t ever want to let my country down .
s : i want to change my life !
i called my wife leslie , and i said , &quot; you know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
i said , &quot; what is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; a job . &quot;
he proposed the film to me , and i said , &quot; yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local tv , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot;
and really , i feel as though , when i see the film -- i have a gesture she does , like this -- i feel like i am a continuation of her gesture .
there &apos;s a prime minister , secretary of state , minister of defense and a cfo , or comptroller .
so i &apos;ll just share with you ...
she marched into the oil field reserves , surrounded it , without firing a shot , and secured it and held it .
so you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
and i can &apos;t design that , i can &apos;t plan that , and i can &apos;t even test that .
i didn &apos;t know what they were doing . i &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
arvind gupta : turning trash into toys for learning
it was a very small village -- a weekly bazaar where people , just once in a week , they put in all the vats .
because if they put tiles on top , it &apos;s just going to crash .
and we have a slogan that the best thing a child can do with a toy is to break it. it &apos;s a very kind of provocative statement -- this old bicycle tube and this old plastic &#91; unclear &#93; this filling cap will go very snugly into an old bicycle tube .
and you put a little fan here .
you can see a gleam in their eye .
this is strips of velcro , this is my drawing slate , and this is my drawing pen , which is basically a film box .
it &apos;s a great cricket cap .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so i &apos;m going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas .
so now i want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea .
and we &apos;d also have a coffee shop , and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms .
and the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps , they stay in tight , spherical beads , which means they &apos;re much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle &apos;s shell .
we &apos;ll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits .
and i firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions .
i know most of you have had the experience of coming back home and finding your kids playing these kinds of games .
the first way is that they &apos;re actually able to resolve small detail in the context of clutter , and though that means being able to read the fine print on a prescription rather than using magnifier glasses , you can actually do it with just your eyesight .
you &apos;re also keeping track of the pedestrian , the running dog , and that &apos;s how you can actually be safe driving , right ?
we obviously don &apos;t ask people to drive around and see how many car accidents they have . that would be a little
i &apos;m much more interested in taking any of you and showing that by forcing you to play an action game , i can actually change your vision for the better , whether you want to play that action game or not , right ?
that &apos;s the chocolate side of the equation .
and during that time , i actually lost more relatives , as well as the teachers who taught me , to hiv / aids .
it &apos;s the idea of computation .
let &apos;s just run all possible programs of the particular type that we &apos;re looking at .
well , then i got to thinking : this scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different --
or let &apos;s try asking about , i don &apos;t know , the international space station .
but , in many ways , we &apos;re still at the very beginning with wolfram alpha .
here &apos;s a big website where we &apos;ve been collecting lots of educational and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things .
well , then the universe has to evolve by applying little rules that progressively update this network .
so , that was , fair to say , an astonishing talk .
these people are tall .
because my mother was a woman , she was not allowed to own any property , and by default , everything in my family anyway belongs to my father , so he had the right .
and the day before the actual ceremony happens , we were dancing , having excitement , and through all the night we did not sleep .
i told him , &quot; well , i want to go to where you are , &quot; because this man looked very happy , and i admired that .
he gave me a list of another 15 men that i went -- 16 more men -- every single morning i went and visited them .
she &apos;s beaten .
as a new dawn is happening in my school , a new beginning is happening .
we &apos;ve questioned where we &apos;re going .
and of course our banks did as well , as did our federal government .
i &apos;ll give you some examples . lets talk about dentists , vasectomies , guns and shark attacks . okay ?
but seriously , we also have this phenomenon on madison avenue and in other places , where people are actually walking out of luxury boutiques with ordinary , sort of generic paper bags to hide the brand purchases .
and , as a result , businesses must provide not only value , but values .
did you know that 68 percent of americans now carry a library card ?
in my book i talked about the fact that 72 percent of people trust what other people say about a brand or a company , versus 15 percent on advertising .
so what credentials does zagat &apos;s have ?
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and praise really does have to be genuine , but she takes responsibility for that .
how can we have world peace with different cultures , different languages ?
and today i would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and also some supernatural creatures called the djinni .
it will dry up inside .
what she didn &apos;t know was that i thought my life was terribly boring , and the last thing i wanted to do was to write about myself .
in my mid-twenties , i moved to istanbul , the city i adore .
but we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap between the mind and the tongue .
if you &apos;re a woman writer from the muslim world , like me , then you are expected to write the stories of muslim women and , preferably , the unhappy stories of unhappy muslim women .
i want to love and celebrate fiction for what it is , not as a means to an end .
we know a lot about each other , or so we think --
i think it was a wonderful paradigm shift .
i think these are the basic elements of all creativity .
now , american copyright and patent laws run counter to this notion that we build on the work of others .
that is all there is to it . apple has patented this .
&quot; i jump &apos; em from other writers but i arrange &apos; em my own way . &quot; i think this is mostly what we do .
and it &apos;s one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob .
so , to find strong evidence of liquid , pools of liquid , beneath the surface of a moon 750 million miles away from the earth is really quite astounding .
a famous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that saved 1968 , which was a turbulent year -- the student riots in paris , the height of the vietnam war .
and now , this is a picture of atoms in the sun &apos;s atmosphere absorbing light .
so that star is also 50 million light years away .
it looks like saturn because , of course , it is .
it &apos;s been said that astronomy &apos;s a humbling and character-building experience .
he says , &quot; ok , but what is the name of that block ? &quot;
in most music , we think of the &quot; one &quot; as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
it helps them suggest books for me to read or movies for my family to watch or friends for us to connect with .
so let me fast-forward through the rest of my day .
you can download it , install it in firefox , to see who is tracking you across the web and following you through the digital woods .
well , i want to take you on this journey .
and so , on my 27th birthday i decided , because i argued so much and i talk so much , that i was going to stop speaking for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest .
you don ’ t … ?
they saw that i was really interested in the environment , and they really wanted to help me along the way .
no one was interested in oil spills .
how could that be , how could that be ?
it took me 100 miles to figure out that , in my heart , in me , i had become a prisoner .
because we are the environment , and how we treat each other is really how we ’ re going to treat the environment .
i was myself pregnant while i was doing the research for the book .
it even makes its cries sound like the mother &apos;s language , which may further endear the baby to the mother , and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language .
will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity ?
this keeps the fetus alive in the short-term , but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs , deprived early on , become more susceptible to disease .
what looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances .
it was the poet samuel taylor coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind .
he said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think .
we polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole .
one of them was : why is it necessary to spend six billion pounds speeding up the eurostar train when , for about 10 percent of that money , you could have top supermodels , male and female , serving free chateau petrus to all the passengers for the entire duration of the journey ?
it &apos;s the lift , it &apos;s a series of buttons in the lift .
now , here &apos;s another thing that happens , which is what i call sometimes &quot; terminal 5 syndrome , &quot; which is that big , expensive things get big , highly-intelligent attention , and they &apos;re great , and terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent , until you get down to the small detail , the usability , which is the signage , which is catastrophic .
and they do it three times as often . &quot;
i thought it was very indecent of accenture to ditch tiger woods in such a sort of hurried and hasty way .
it all became music to me .
and it &apos;s mostly advertised for its motion sensor capabilities : so you can swing a tennis racket , or hit a baseball bat .
for the second demo , i have this wii remote
and i also was taught , coupled with that , that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job , apparently , to help .
i started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth , because i wasn &apos;t doing more , apparently , to make things better .
think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day .
they might be able to buy mosquito nets . maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure . maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when i came as their guest and that made them feel proud .
let &apos;s start for real . &quot; that was our official launch .
the first one is , as i mentioned , entrepreneurship was a new idea to me .
that &apos;s around 130 billion dollars a year --
thanks .
if we extrapolate back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago .
the first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago .
thank you for listening .
so this is a project i &apos;m working on , and this is a series of front covers to downgrade our super , hyper — to downgrade our super , hyper-mobile phones into the essence of their function .
these lovely patterns . and then this last one , one of my favorites , this pinwheel design .
bingo ! now i &apos;m told that &apos;s not just a squid phenomenon with males , but i don &apos;t know .
i thought it was all graphics -- so here it is in reverse .
after i was invited by ted , i did some digging , because that &apos;s what we do , to know about my host .
but you could ask , how could these large mammals live in this desert environment ?
in a way , this was like the second birth for the child , after 3.3 million years , but the labor was very long .
and more interesting , however , is the brain in this child was still growing .
up to now , the knowledge that we had about our ancestors came essentially from adult individuals because the fossils , the baby fossils , were missing .
thank you .
as a result , we have garbage patches the size of twice-texas .
but the sargasso sea , the same way it aggregates sargassum weed , actually is pulling in the plastic from throughout the region .
many species are headed through this region , which is why there &apos;s been so much attention put into conservation of the eastern tropical pacific seascape .
at the same time we &apos;re saying , &quot; yes , we need more . we need to move forward . &quot;
why do people succeed ? is it because they &apos;re smart ? or are they just lucky ? neither . analyst richard st. john condenses years of interviews into an unmissable 3-minute slideshow on the real secrets of success .
now it &apos;s not always easy to push yourself , and that &apos;s why they invented mothers .
and what miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
now a lot of you are probably familiar with deb roy who , back in march , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
in other words , to keep operating at our current level , we need 50 percent more earth than we &apos;ve got .
that &apos;s all true .
now we &apos;ve had 50 years of warnings .
i want to do so because , in my view , the most important issue we face is how we respond to this question .
yes , things will get ugly , and it will happen soon -- certainly in our lifetime -- but we are more than capable of getting through everything that &apos;s coming .
and this is where you come in .
&lt; transcript &gt;
he gives half of them vitamin b12 .
i see it in our business leaders .
and what we learned is cesar &apos;s work is far too good to explain in the new york times magazine .
and we have a problem-solving technique that works .
now if you ascribe to the god complex , what you do is you find yourself a little god .
that is a huge failure rate .
we &apos;re going to test them out . they &apos;ll probably all fail .
you &apos;re killing people with your clinical trials . you need to shut it down now .
his friend , goro shimura -- who worked on the mathematics with him -- many decades later , reflected on taniyama &apos;s life .
the government , meanwhile , has been acting like santa claus .
and you &apos;ve got to start banishing a word that &apos;s called &quot; entitlement . &quot;
that &apos;s the short term . that &apos;s the flame part .
twenty-one countries came together . dozens of teams .
and we can do it with other things .
this is not an intelligence turing rest , but this is as close as you can get to a physical turing test .
and , of course , the future is looking back 200 years , because next week is the 200th anniversary of darwin &apos;s birth .
once upon a time , there was a dread disease that afflicted children .
for many years this went along , and everything was fine .
if you put a child in a car seat , 18.2 percent of the children die .
it &apos;s kind of an interesting logic , i think , that people use . and the other logic , they say , &quot; well , the government wouldn &apos;t have told us &#91; to &#93; use them if they weren &apos;t much better . &quot;
these are three-year-old dummies , by the way .
so , i &apos;ll show you the six-year-old crashes as well .
ok , and most of them would not come back , but some of them would come back .
kevin kelly on the next 5,000 days of the web
if there is only one machine , and our little handhelds and devices are actually just little windows into those machines , but that we &apos;re basically constructing a single , global machine .
so to a first approximation , we have these things -- twenty petahertz synapse firings .
but everything , all the cameras , and the microphones , and the sensors in cars and everything is connected to this machine .
the immediacy , the authentication , the personalization . the media wants to be liquid . the reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them , not so that they are &quot; free &quot; as in &quot; beer , &quot; but &quot; free &quot; as in &quot; freedom . &quot;
now we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages , so one page links to another page .
why should you be doing that ? you should just do that once , and it should know who all your friends are .
and we kind of object at first , saying , &quot; oh , that &apos;s awful . &quot;
and i don &apos;t know what else to call it , than the one .
and after about five years of doing this , i was arrested for kidnapping .
i understand how someone &apos;s brain , how someone &apos;s mind can come to the place where it makes sense --
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and it &apos;s not based on an a priori notion .
because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate , and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems .
again , it &apos;s a very , very simple notion .
it &apos;s a wrong attitude , actually , because the hybrid is probably more interesting .
i have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates x , y and z function .
one enters the building as it lifts off the ground , and it becomes part of the idea .
that reflect even rusticated stonework , but which were embedded with fragments of the constitution , which were part of the little process , all set on a plinth that defined it from the community .
we talk about ourselves as omnivores .
we walked out of africa two times .
and two tastes which protect you -- bitter and sour , which are against poisonous and rotten material .
now 150 years ago , anatomists described very , very carefully -- here is a model of a wall of a gut .
it &apos;s called the subsumption architecture .
so now back to the cooking question and back to the design .
anthropologist wade davis muses on the worldwide web of belief and ritual that makes us human . he shares breathtaking photos and stories of the elder brothers , a group of sierra nevada indians whose spiritual practice holds the world in balance .
but the corollary of that is that , if we all are brothers and sisters and share the same genetic material , all human populations share the same raw human genius , the same intellectual acuity .
and with the blessing of trulshik rinpoche , we began a pilgrimage to a curious destination , accompanied by a great doctor .
i only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day than anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant .
values that maintain the proposition that their prayers , and their prayers alone , maintain the cosmic balance .
not simply to the flanks of the mountains , but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims .
i was up in the high arctic to tell a story about global warming , inspired in part by the former vice president &apos;s wonderful book .
this does not have to happen .
perhaps even worse is when it finds its way into our oceans , like in the great plastic gyre , where these materials are being mechanically broken into smaller and smaller bits , but they &apos;re not really going away .
now , mycelium is an amazing material , because it &apos;s a self-assembling material .
our entire facility is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools sitting indoors in the dark , quietly self-assembling materials -- and everything from building materials to , in this case , a packaging corner block .
natural polymers , well ... i think that &apos;s what &apos;s most important , because these polymers have been tried and tested in our ecosystem for the last billion years , in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans .
well , except they &apos;ve been pre-warned now , and they &apos;ll know you &apos;re making it up .
so suppose we toss a coin repeatedly .
who thinks that c is true -- that , on average , it &apos;ll take less time to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail ?
and you keep tossing , to wait for the next head , to get excited .
and i will give you two little snippets -- two examples -- of projects we &apos;re involved in in my group in oxford , both of which i think are rather exciting .
so a natural answer is 99 percent .
each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit .
and secondly , it &apos;s palpably false .
and then if she were trying to kill the children , she succeeded .
to go back to the legal context , at the sally clark trial all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said .
the smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands of lives , worldwide .
okay , two more points . every year in the usa , roughly 2,500 children are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries related to electrical receptacles . and this is crazy .
and when it comes to sensory restoration , we &apos;re still very far away from being able to provide beauty .
owl . owl .
girl : yes i do . i remember writing every chapter .
when you hear music , if it doesn &apos;t sound good , what &apos;s the point ?
if we could play these two sound clips in succession .
because his grave was exhumed .
and it was absolutely wonderful .

you get now a dna stapler instead . these are the kind of molecular programs that we want to be able to write , but the problem is , we don &apos;t know the machine language of proteins . we don &apos;t have a compiler for proteins .
and if it &apos;s the case that we can reach that level of complexity , if our ability to program molecules gets to be that good , then that will truly be magic . thank you very much .
you could even hear it .
they meant to rule by means of repression .
the gun may be one of the most important instruments of peace and stability that we have in this world .
with trade , there &apos;s mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties .
i stand for this soldier who suffered partial hearing loss and sustained permanent injuries to her leg , which was hit by a rocket on a mission in afghanistan .
and then from that point on , you &apos;re basically falling .
to execute it effectively .
we &apos;ve heard a lot about the promise of technology , and the peril .
and if you ask me , will the price of google be higher or lower than it is today three years from now , that &apos;s very hard to say .
so the first step in biological evolution , the evolution of dna -- actually it was rna came first -- took billions of years , but then evolution used that information-processing backbone to bring on the next stage .
and that &apos;s exponential growth through five different paradigms .
as we make them smaller and less expensive , the electrons have less distance to travel .
they didn &apos;t get diabetes ; they didn &apos;t get heart disease ; they lived 20 percent longer ; they got the health benefits of caloric restriction without the restriction .
there &apos;s one nano-engineered device that cures type 1 diabetes . it &apos;s blood cell-sized .
we &apos;ve had productivity go from 30 dollars to 150 dollars per hour of labor in the last 50 years .
you can go there with other people , have any kind of experience with anyone involving all of the senses .
it &apos;s like a water dowsing device .
and sometimes a really is connected to b ,
this is the only equation in the talk by the way .
just shout out anything you see .
an increase of dopamine caused subjects to see more patterns than those that did not receive the dopamine .
the other one also , but maybe too many patterns .
the impossible crate illusion .
well , we know exactly where it happens , in the temporal lobe , right across , sort of above your ear there ,
but this is a pattern detection problem , isn &apos;t it ?
you get a hypoxia , or a lower oxygen .
girl : okay .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on galapagos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
and i went sailing on it , and we did surveys throughout the southern south china sea and especially the java sea .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
that is for people who can see a marine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provides , which enables them to reset their baseline .
and most dung beetles actually wrap it into a package of some sort .
and what do you think they could be looking at as they climb on top of the ball ?
how far can we push them before they will reorientate themselves ?
and what &apos;s of interest here is that little brain is quite cool .
and he doesn &apos;t like this first position , but he comes up with a second position , and about 50 minutes later , that nest is finished , and he heads off to forage and provision at a pile of dry dung pellets .
shame .
i didn &apos;t do it as well , but we managed to get youssou n &apos;dour , sting , tracy chapman , and bruce springsteen to go &apos; round the world for amnesty , and it was an amazing experience .
the one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape evelyn .
and we &apos;ve also been trying to get computers out to the world , so that groups can communicate much more effectively , campaign much more effectively , but now we have the wonderful possibility , which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it , because that is cheap ; it &apos;s ubiquitous ; and it &apos;s moving fast all around the world -- and it &apos;s very exciting for us .
what we get from this adventure is just sheer joy , and joy , after all , is the end of life .
the ice is always moving , breaking up , drifting around , refreezing , so the scenery that i saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me . no one else will ever , could ever , possibly see the views , the vistas , that i saw for 10 weeks .
it is , arguably , the most audacious endeavor of that edwardian golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels , that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job .
so i think it &apos;s safe to say i know a little bit about the process of pitching .
if you &apos;re not passionate about your own company , why on earth should anyone else be passionate ?
and you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead , to inspire them , to motivate them to be part of your team .
you can &apos;t say , &quot; hey , i &apos;ve got high integrity , invest in me ! &quot; right ?
you stop , you &apos;ve got to figure it out .
anything that makes me think . anything that i don &apos;t understand , where i have to make the leap myself , in my own head , is going to stop the flow of the presentation .
no , they &apos;re not .
this is not a five-minute pitch . this is , you know , two sentences .
whether you have a distribution relationship with somebody , you know , you have a producing partner . or , you know , again , validation .

powerpoint has this built into every copy of powerpoint that &apos;s shipped .
you &apos;re making a connection with your audience over here , and you always want to do a one-on-one connection .
where do we rank three weeks ago in another report by the oecd ?
in case some of you forgot what play is , this is what play looks like .
but we need to remember that baba &apos;s been infected by the serious meme for 45 years .
in social , in education and in our business , don &apos;t value play .
the more you play , the bigger the brains there are .
these are the benefits to play .
it improves our ability to learn .
i asked them all .
i &apos;m going to let you make decisions . i &apos;m going to empower you ,
what we need is a players &apos; uprising .
all of these things were made during the last 75 years .
as i said , i started to do these things 75 years ago .
so he asked me , could he please visit me , and then finally he did , and explained to me that what i did now in my shop was an anachronism , that the industrial revolution had broken out , and that i rather should join the factory .
and among other things , other countries i worked , was in the soviet union , where i worked from &apos; 32 to &apos; 37 -- actually , to &apos; 36 .
you &apos;ve got to make something good out of something bad .
it &apos;s the only copy i had . pieces of it .
alisa volkman : so this is where our story begins -- the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son , declan .
rg : when we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at , with these beautiful images , and looked at the scene in our actual living room , it looked a little bit more like this .
and you can see , our eyes were glistening .
av : i don &apos;t want to embarrass him too much . but i am going to give him three seconds .
so your 58 percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness .
and i felt like i happened upon this secret society of women that i now was a part of , which was reassuring and also really concerning .
there &apos;s something missing from these studies .
there &apos;s another factor in our case .

was a beloved pianist , maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century .
ultimately , i started with the experience .
your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement , you know .
we &apos;ve seen all these &quot; star treks , &quot; and they &apos;re all holodeck episodes as well .
geoff mulgan : post-crash , investing in a better world
and when people aren &apos;t allowed to be useful , they soon think that they &apos;re useless .
when times are hard , people have to do things for themselves , and right across the world , oxford , omaha , omsk , you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming , people taking over land , taking over roofs , turning barges into temporary farms .
on what people do to other people , often one to one , rather than simply selling them a product .
and some are quite structural , like social impact bonds where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime or helping old people keep out of hospital , and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are .
i &apos;m not suggesting the crowds are about to storm the barricades and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost , though that might be quite tempting .
so all the way over on the left of this graph , what you see is many oecd countries saving over a quarter of their gdp every year , and some oecd countries saving over a third of their gdp per year .
it &apos;s simply not permissible in english to say , &quot; it rain tomorrow . &quot;
and interestingly enough , there are pockets of futureless language speakers situated all over the world .
combine that with a world value survey , which measures the political opinions and , fortunately for me , the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world .
and that &apos;s exactly what we find .
but it was she who ended up learning all the arabic words for the local plants , as well as their uses -- medicinal uses , cosmetics , cooking , herbal .
so everybody wants to have an english education , naturally .
and so light shone upon the dark ages of europe .
let me tell you a story about two scientists , two english scientists .
use it to spread great ideas .
and brian allen was able , in a miraculous flight , to get the gossamer albatross across the english channel , and we won the 100,000-pound , 200,000-dollar prize for that . and when all expenses were paid , the debt was handled , and everything was fine .
and they form little groups , all fighting with each other , and when i leave , two hours later , most of them are saying about 2 billion people , and they don &apos;t have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion , nor do i , but i think they &apos;re right and this is a serious problem .
it sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator .
this was flying around in the party last night , and -- -- you can see how it just can fly around , and you can spy on anybody you want .
so the coffee cup , or the cup with a handle , is one of the tools used by society to maintain public health .
and , since this is coming from a moral philosopher , the fourth would be that it &apos;s part of god &apos;s plan for the universe .
here &apos;s another example , which i put up because it &apos;s an example of really important current science .
it starts with binary .
so that &apos;s the next layer of simplicity , and , in fact , integrated circuits are really simple in the sense that they , in general , work really well .
that is , you can stack them .
one of them is from mr. einstein ,
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and he was discontented with the state of people &apos;s practice of the buddhist religion in india at that time .
again , no vision of maitreya after nine years .
so he starts to do that . he can &apos;t grab the maggots . apparently they wriggle around . they &apos;re kind of hard to grab , these maggots .
the future buddha has come ahead of all predictions . here he is . &quot;
so , my mother in this life is really great . but all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother .
but you think of him as a mom .
how boring to run around chasing you .
and so the next step -- the sixth step beyond &quot; universal compassion &quot; -- is this thing where you &apos;re linked with the needs of others in a true way , and you have compassion for yourself also , and it isn &apos;t sentimental only . you might be in fear of something .
and take universal responsibility for them . and then , not only will god smile and the eternal mama will smile , but karen armstrong will smile .
it &apos;s when the internet combines with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers -- who are knowledgeable ; they &apos;ve got the incentive to innovate ; they &apos;ve got the tools ; they want to -- that you get this kind of explosion of creative collaboration .
so the more radical the innovation , the more the uncertainty , the more you need innovation in use to work out what a technology is for .
they work at their leisure , if you like .
and so the debates about copyright , digital rights , so on and so forth -- these are all about trying to stifle , in my view , these kinds of organizations .
what &apos;s happening there is that the whole domain of creativity is expanding .
how many people does he employ to service that population ?
&lt; / transcript &gt;
but this project changed the way that i thought about connecting to people .
hundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts .
when they smile -- right , you &apos;ve seen people stop -- all of a sudden , life is being lived there , somewhere up in that weird , dense network .
and people called in and left messages like this . recording : okay , here &apos;s something .
and he said , &quot; i &apos;m dressed as batman to hide my identity . &quot;
so i asked for people &apos;s usernames and passwords to be sent to me .
and when you put them together , something magical happens , something absolutely incredible happens , and all of a sudden i get a chorus from around the world .
so we &apos;re interested in exactly where in the brain , and what &apos;s the most important part of the brain .
so it doesn &apos;t work later on in life .
she goes , &quot; no it gets worse , read this book . &quot;
brian cox on cern &apos;s supercollider
and the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything &apos;s made of , and how everything sticks together .
and these particles have been discovered over the last century , pretty much .
a bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me .
and imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room .
but actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together , back at the big bang --
and on some of those planets , the oxygen , which had been created in that first generation of stars , could fuse with hydrogen to form water , liquid water on the surface .
art was part of the answer , and my name , in the very beginning , was linked with two things : demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back , and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city .
thirty-seven said no , we don &apos;t like it .
they were paying in order to skip the queue , the long queue .
it is about how people think , how they view the world around them , how they use their time and their energy .
players who didn &apos;t smile in their pictures lived an average of only 72.9 years , where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost 80 years .
in a related german study , researchers used fmri imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting botox to suppress smiling muscles .
government institutions were completely decapitated , including the presidential palace .
and we wanted it to be easy to use .
young people living in kibera in their community , with simple handheld devices , gps handheld devices and sms-enabled mobile phones , have literally put themselves on the map .
people are understanding , from cairo to oakland , that there are new ways to come together , there are new ways to mobilize , there are new ways to influence .
but what i &apos;ve come to learn is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures , but in the simple accumulation of gentle , soft , almost invisible acts of compassion , everyday acts of compassion .
why don &apos;t they use it ? &quot;
and they would sing them only when they planted the rice , as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead into the rice .
anyway , a goat &apos;s eyes are like a child &apos;s eyes .
the name was john james , and in those days , if a family member committed a crime , the military would hold you as ransom till your family turned themselves in .
this is how they came to reclaim their humanity .
however , the vehicles you see here are big .
so here r is the characteristic length of the robot .
so one of the problems with these small robots is their payload carrying capacity . so you might want to have multiple robots carry payloads .
so another thing the robot can do is it remembers pieces of trajectory that it learns or is pre-programmed .
plus the robots have to base their actions only on local information , what they sense from their neighbors .
so all these experiments you &apos;ve seen thus far , all these demonstrations , have been done with the help of motion capture systems .
i want to conclude with a music video .
here you can see some pictures of what are called green roofs , or urban agriculture .
we think , oh , bees , countryside , agriculture , but that &apos;s not what the bees are showing .
many of us will remember our childhood growing up , maybe you got stung by a bee , you saw bees on flowers .
and then one day i said , &quot; why don &apos;t we just do an oral vaccine ? &quot; it &apos;s like , &quot; ugh , &quot; so that &apos;s what we do .
what can you do to save the bees or to help them or to think of sustainable cities in the future ?
first of all , a little bit of audience participation .
it was only 200 years ago that we had the advent of the industrial revolution .
what happened to our bread in the meantime ?
how many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals ?
if we say just small-scale production , as is the tendency here , to go back to local food means that a poor man like hans rosling cannot even eat oranges anymore because in scandinavia we don &apos;t have oranges .
but yes there are some solutions .
and i want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses and from the fermentation of crops to heat our residential areas .
and never before have we had the luxury of taking it for granted because it is now so cheap .
because that is the only way i &apos;m going to get my story across to you .
and it is a marvelous rain forest .
usually they eat something a bit larger .
you drink it in peril of your life .
but then the monsoon arrives , and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or there is always a barrage , and , shoop , they get washed down to their doom .
it &apos;s a place that &apos;s famous to a lot of you who know about the bandits , the dacoits who used to work up there . and there still are quite a few around .
but if you stroll down to the yamuna or to the gomati in lucknow , or to the adyar river in chennai , or the mula-mutha river in pune , just see what we &apos;re capable of doing to a river . it &apos;s sad .
but this guy who we &apos;re following right now is in the deep jungle .
for reversing disease , that ’ s what it takes , but if you ’ re just trying to be healthy , you have a spectrum of choices .
it ’ s important , but not enough .
so does cocaine , so does a high fat diet , so does emotional stress .
and it ’ s the volume of food that affects satiety , rather than the type of food .
you ’ ll lose even more weight if you go to whole foods and less fat , and you ’ ll enhance your health rather than harming it .
so we took some of their blood serum and sent it down to ucla ; they added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells growing in tissue culture , and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group than in the control group -- 70 versus 9 percent .
and at the end of it , somebody said , &quot; hey , swami , what ’ s the difference between wellness and illness ? &quot;
girl : you &apos;re different than anybody i &apos;ve ever met .
he wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor .
you know , this is some tough stuff .
so we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything a human being can do .
and of course , these transcend age , race , culture , gender .
and we also brought in a gentleman named kazu tsuji , and kazu tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time .
but now we needed to get brad &apos;s performance to drive our virtual benjamin .
we found the old adage , you know , &quot; the eyes are the window to the soul , &quot; absolutely true .
but ... maybe not .
so , we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner .
education . the kids never went to school .
&#91; shit &#93; this is arguably the back end of the design of animals .
and eventually , our worst nightmare happened : they flooded the engine .
go underneath it . go above it . go around it .
so not only do they have the very long eyelashes , but there &apos;s the secondary -- i guess you &apos;d call it the &#91; unclear &#93; or whatever .
we &apos;re kind of like buds , but i &apos;m also a male as well and he &apos;s -- kb : he sees you as competition ? senior keeper : yeah , exactly .
and we &apos;ve seen that repeatedly through this conference -- not just this year , but in past years .
i think more influential than emily dickinson or coleridge or wordsworth on my imagination were warner brothers , merrie melodies and loony tunes cartoons .
and i think you could boil this poem down to saying , &quot; some days you eat the bear , other days the bear eats you . &quot; and it uses the imagery of dollhouse furniture .
and when i would go up to the country , he would teach me things like deer hunting , which meant getting lost with a gun basically -- and trout fishing and stuff like that .
it took a long time -- i mean , it &apos;s rather uncommon to have this marriage -- a long time to put those two together .
derek sivers : how to start a movement
but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry .
so it had its downsides .
this was no small feat , because if you listen to dermatologists , they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen .
i was so focused on doing all these things that i was neglecting my friends and family .
and by the way , it &apos;s also terrible for your brain .
i do experiments to test how different chemicals in the brain influence the choices we make .
or would i go on television to demonstrate , in front of a live audience , that comfort foods really do make you feel better ?
the headline ? &quot; you love your iphone . literally . &quot; it quickly became the most emailed article on the site .
we see it in supermarkets , on book covers .
rajesh rao is fascinated by &quot; the mother of all crossword puzzles &quot; : how to decipher the 4000 year old indus script . at ted 2011 he tells how he is enlisting modern computational techniques to read the indus language , the key piece to understanding this ancient civilization .
but who is this person ?
so you know those packing slips you get on your fedex boxes ?
so as i showed you , they &apos;re usually found on these seals that are very , very tiny .
and so that &apos;s one of the first things we know , that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts .
in the rest of the cases , typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer .
we found that the indus script actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts .
they used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived ,
and i &apos;d like to give you a quick example of parpola &apos;s work .
what would they tell us ?
radio astronomers study radio waves from space using sensitive antennas and receivers , which give them precise information about what an astronomical object is and where it is in our night sky .
but going from slinging some wire across rooftops in boston to laying thousands and thousands of miles of cable on the atlantic ocean seabed is no easy matter .
but the noise didn &apos;t disappear .
they actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that .
who &apos;s not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings -- if you &apos;re different from all the other beings ?
and then it &apos;s never good enough .
so , compassion means to feel the feelings of others , and the human being actually is compassion .
tempt was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s .
and he &apos;s seriously one of the funniest -- i call him yoda , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; i &apos;m not worthy . this guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot; the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
i feel like i had been held underwater , and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so i could breathe . &quot; isn &apos;t that awesome ?
this is kim , a nine-year-old vietnam girl , her back ruined by napalm , and she awakened the conscience of the nation of america to begin to end the vietnam war .
they won public opinion over a long period of time .
amy winehouse said , &quot; nelson mandela and i have a lot in common .
you cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources .
so my argument today is basically this .
if we go to the dictionary , it says , &quot; it &apos;s the lower extremity of a leg that is in direct contact with the ground in standing or walking &quot; that &apos;s the traditional definition .
you can do another experiment where you can take a cockroach with a foot , and you can remove its foot .
can this help us inspire the design of novel robots ?
the crabs are missing spines , so they have a problem in this kind of rough terrain .
we can actually model that behavior better as a fluid , if you look at it .
you see what happens ?
the gecko has a billion of these 200-nanometer-sized split ends .
and here are rise &apos;s first steps on an incline .
don &apos;t put it all in the brain , but put some of the control in tuned feet , legs and even body .
the first thing that got me interested in the sounds of these underwater animals , whose world was so foreign to me , was evidence from captive dolphins that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds .
what this figure shows is the percentage of the separations in which dolphins whistle , against the maximum distance .
so it could have a negative impact on the whole population .
what happened was , during the cold war , the u.s. navy had a system that was secret at the time , that they used to track russian submarines .
you can hear the full frequency range . it &apos;s quite loud .
that in this frequency range where whales communicate , the main source globally , on our planet , for the noise comes from human ships , thousands of human ships , distant , far away , just all aggregating .
it &apos;s an amazing shift , induced by humans over this large scale , in both time and space .
well , biologists who couldn &apos;t take no for an answer went to the international maritime organization and petitioned them to say , &quot; can &apos;t you move that lane ? those are just lines on the ground .
&lt; transcript &gt;
second : you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides . and i &apos;m not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you &apos;re seeing , but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe , who can share their enthusiasm and can make the universe a welcoming place . and third , you can create your own tours -- you can share them with friends , you can create them with friends -- and that &apos;s the part that i think i &apos;m most excited about because i think that at heart , we are all storytellers . and in telling stories , each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way .
&lt; transcript &gt;
there &apos;s something i &apos;m developing here called social intensity syndrome , which tries to account for why guys really prefer male bonding over female mating .
i &apos;m here to alarm . it &apos;s your job to solve .
google should have something like this in their lobby .
jeff han : i &apos;m a research scientist at nyu in new york .
and then what i can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time .
it will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons .
even of salinas .
and we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
there are examples of this kind of action in mexico .
i think anyone who has stepped foot on this land -- not to mention all mexican people -- will agree that it &apos;s not difficult to love mexico .
anyone can kill me , or you , or you .
i do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it .
and then you get crazy .
ok , so since you all don &apos;t understand what the five-ball pattern is , i &apos;m going to give you a little clue .
now , one more time , and -- finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger , finger . open .
trying to figure that stuff out . but is it going to get you anywhere ?
because i use ramps of different parabolas that i roll the balls on while i &apos;m keeping time with this .
so , i &apos;ll come back to that in a second . but working with one ball , now , what if you attach something to it , or change it .
and what it involves , and i don &apos;t know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not , but i &apos;ll do a little bit of it .
and if you were here last year , i probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new eyemodule 2 , which was a camera that plugged into the handspring .
you pick them up , and once you see something that you &apos;re interested in , the staff person can scan them in and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store .
the next video is not done by us .
the pavilion &apos;s design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful .

after her name , written in brackets was the apt description , horse face .
so that &apos;s why we don &apos;t think it exists , the sufi masters working on us .
time , nobody can see time .
gas , you can &apos;t see that .
and he said , &quot; well , i &apos;ve no idea .
so we assembled a team of experts , spanning harvard , mit , the american heritage dictionary , the encyclopedia britannica and even our proud sponsors , the google .
since then , the authors have won on 129 million distinct occasions , publishing books .
let &apos;s suppose that i am thriving , then tomorrow i want to tell you about how well i did .
in fact , 1950 was so fascinating that for years thereafter , people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened , in &apos; 51 , &apos; 52 , &apos; 53 .
now these signals are actually so strong that we don &apos;t need to know that someone was censored .
we have to make this available for people . &quot; so in two weeks flat -- the two weeks before our paper came out -- they coded up a version of the ngram viewer for the general public .
these all happen to be on our computers , on computers across the world .
sound places us in space and in time .
this is not trivial .
it &apos;s around us all the time .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
it was one of the best issues ever . and they talked about the neuron and development and disease and vision and all the things you might want to know about brains . it was really quite impressive .
that &apos;s when i designed all those computer products .
this works in physics . this works in geology . but if this is normal science , what does neuroscience look like ? this is what neuroscience looks like .
it &apos;s not as complex as it looks . that &apos;s not the issue .
and now it &apos;s not that hard , you know , here &apos;s the apple , here &apos;s the orange , you know , the earth goes around , that kind of stuff .
a behavioral metric of what intelligence is , and this has stuck in our minds for a long period of time .
neocortex means new layer . it is a new layer on top of your brain .
so we are now able to make very sophisticated motor planning , things like that .
and that &apos;s because you &apos;re making a prediction .
not like computer memory . it &apos;s not at all like computer memory .
we can also do intelligent security systems .
it is a sustainable peace in which the majority of people on this planet have access to enough resources to live dignified lives , where these people have enough access to education and health care , so that they can live in freedom from want and freedom from fear .
i was in hiroshima a couple of weeks ago , and his holiness -- we &apos;re sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city , and there were about eight of us nobel laureates .
and instead of going home , she conferred with all the other women that she works with , who said to her , &quot; stay out . we need you out .
she is now running for president .
throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood , and she had hand washed laundry for seven children .
and the remaining five billion , how do they wash ?
and these ones who have washing machines , but not a house full of other machines , they use two .
it &apos;s a real challenge in the future .
&lt; transcript &gt;
we had a financial regulatory regime based on the assumptions that traders were rational creatures who wouldn &apos;t do anything stupid .
it would be a big seller .
and this leads to oddities .
when we watch a car chase in a movie , it &apos;s almost as if we are subtly having a car chase .
they have trouble relating to other people .
and the effectiveness of a group is not determined by the iq of the group ; it &apos;s determined by how well they communicate , how often they take turns in conversation .
through the policy failures of the last 30 years , we have come to acknowledge , i think , how shallow our view of human nature has been .
but what people really often think about the dictionary is , they think more like this .
computers ! what about computers ?
so -- -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham butt problem .
you know , there &apos;re still going to be paper dictionaries , but it &apos;s not going to be the dominant dictionary .
but if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic , but maybe to count the cars that go by , then more eyeballs are better .
and we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
and words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography . isn &apos;t that great ?
it wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
they are sold in the name of forced labor , camel jockeying , anything , everything .
these are men who buy you for an hour , for a day , and use you , throw you .
you see a girl here who is trained as a welder .
it &apos;s very nice for discussion , discourse , making films and everything .
i &apos;m asking you this because no child , no human being , deserves what these children have gone through .
february 2001 -- in one day we laid off 350 people , and before the bloodshed was finished , 1,000 people had lost their jobs from my companies . i felt sick .
but something as basic as happiness , which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion in the church or mosque or synagogue , today it turns out that there &apos;s dozens of ted-like questions that you can ask about it , which are really interesting .
truth , curiosity , diversity , no selling , no corporate bullshit , no bandwagoning , no platforms .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and at the slightest sound , they hide back again .
soren enters the room . pop ! he goes invisible .
so i &apos;m going to show you a very quick video where we are doing a test scenario -- it &apos;s much faster .
so those who are &quot; yes , &quot; raise your hand . &quot; for . &quot;
electricity for cities , at its best , is what &apos;s called baseload electricity .
solar &apos;s wonderful on rooftops .
so arguing against , a man who &apos;s been at the nitty , gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years .
so the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind , or something else .
as you can see from these pictures , the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land , range land or open space .
you can either have wind or nuclear .
you can make it reliable , as i showed with that diagram .
tell me that those accidents aren &apos;t going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years .
ray kurzweil and all the other talks -- we know that the stick is going up exponentially .
there &apos;s plenty of resource . you can make it reliable .
in fact , the earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources .
they had to make up everything . and that , my friend , is amazing motivation .
if you calculate the amount of potential energy , mgh , to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles , and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour --
pilot : release our fire .
people think a zero gravity room , there &apos;s a switch on there that turns it off -- but it &apos;s actually parabolic flight of an airplane .
if you were going to go and try to create spaceshipone , or any kind of a new technology , you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome .
&lt; transcript &gt;
a simple volume , the cube .
we can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are -- all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding .
there &apos;s too many surfaces , there &apos;s too much detail , one can &apos;t see the end state .
machines are getting faster , it &apos;s getting less expensive , and there &apos;s some promising technological developments just on the horizon .
what made me do this work ? i shall go into my story .
and i thought , &quot; these ants , are they looking for the queen ant ?
and i &apos;ll explain .
because that has happened to me .
which i held and stretched .
whenever you work on that level , things behave different .
and whilst i &apos;m painting i have to be very careful ,
and she saw me walking around like this .
well , i can look at this one and i can be very proud of this ,
and that &apos;s 24-karat gold . and it &apos;s constructed . i built it .
her answer was quite the contrary .
in a time where the world is becoming personalized , when the mobile phone , the burger , the telephone , everything has its own personal identity , how should we perceive ourselves
in few hours , shirin neshat , my friend from iran who &apos;s a very important artist for us will be talking to you .
today i am proud to say we have trained and educated over 66 qatari women filmmakers to edit , tell their own stories in their own voices .
&quot; know thyself , &quot; that is the journey of self-expression and self-realization that we are traveling .
how can we go to a greater battle ? &quot;
that is a moment which is a gift of god to us -- a gift when , for a moment , he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on &quot; i , i , i , me , me , me , &quot; and instead , like the person in rumi &apos;s story , we say , &quot; oh , this is all you .
the angels prostrate , not before the human body , but before the human soul .
my mangled body flew in one direction , my mangled bike flew in the other .
when they were born at 6 : 14 and 6 : 46 on april 15 , 2005 , our otherwise grim , humorless doctor looked at his watch , and was like , &quot; hmm , april 15th -- tax day .
and it &apos;s apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia , but not to have hair from texas .
and i snuck out behind ,
and as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland -- the glint that says , &quot; let &apos;s go cow tipping , &quot; even though we never did tip the cow , even though no one tips the cow , even though cows don &apos;t sleep standing up .
and one night i got a call from my mother-in-law that my daughters , at that time three and a half , were missing me and feeling my absence .
in fact , if i cling to one memory of this year , it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers grasping the handle underneath my hand .
he said , &quot; i don &apos;t see the wall , &quot; and i &apos;m telling you the same , don &apos;t see the wall .
behold the world in pause .
i got good news that day , and i stand here today cancer-free , walking without aid and hobbling forward .
and this man , he has been outside , but he &apos;s gone back , and he was saying , &quot; you know , we have suddenly jumped into a whole new era , and we didn &apos;t even know about the white man 50 years ago , and now here we are with laptop computers , and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world .
especially when chimpanzees , and other animals with large brains , are studied in captivity ,
anyway , david greybeard -- and i saw that he was picking little pieces of grass and using them to fish termites from their underground nest .
we find that they show emotions , similar to -- maybe sometimes the same -- as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness , sadness , fear , despair .
we see deforestation ; we see the desert spreading ; we see massive hunger ; we see disease and we see population growth in areas where there are more people living on a certain piece of land than the land can possibly support ,
and the more i talked about the chimpanzees &apos; plight , the more i realized the fact that everything &apos;s interconnected ,
so , the roots and shoots program involves youth in three kinds of projects .
and then , lo and behold , there &apos;s another group answering these kids who may be in america , or maybe this is a group in israel , saying , &quot; yeah , you did it a little bit wrong . this is how you should do it . &quot;
firstly , the human brain -- i don &apos;t need to say anything about that .
thank you .
in the laboratory what we want to do is much the same , but with on the order of tens of different types of molecules -- so a drastic reduction in complexity , but still trying to produce something that looks lifelike .
so we &apos;re on a road towards living systems .
on the other hand we have two moving protocells that like to circle each other , and they form a kind of a dance , a complex dance with each other .
so this is similar to what happens when you take pure sugar crystals in your kitchen , you put them in a pan , and you apply energy .
without the sun , there &apos;s likely to be no life on this planet .
this is not the germs that medicos were trained to deal with ; this is a different definition of health , health that has a great advantage because it &apos;s external , it &apos;s shared , we can do something about it , as opposed to internal , genetically predetermined or individualized .
they &apos;re even better models of environmental health , because not only the same mammalian biology , but they share your diet , largely .
and that aggregating effect , that collective action effect , is actually something we can use to our advantage .
and they still remain as icons of civic response in the face of shared , uncertain , collective threat .
in fact , urban migration now describes the movement of animals formerly known as wild into urban centers .
the final project i &apos;d like to show you is a new interface for fish that has just been launched -- it &apos;s actually officially launched next week -- with a wonderful commission from the architectural league .
but in that action , that interaction , by re-scripting that , by changing it into an opportunity to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate , that could augment the nutritional resources that we ourselves have depleted for augmenting the fish population and also adding chelating agent , which , like any chelating agent that we use medicinally , binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and pcbs that are in the fish living in this particular habitat and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt where it &apos;s complexed by a reactive , effectively removing it from bioavailability .
we really have to ask the question : can the world sustain that number of automobiles ?
it &apos;s produced in the fertilizer industry ; it &apos;s produced in the chemical manufacturing industry .
we find that premise quite exciting .
the substance of things unseen .
i started seeing paintings like this .
or the swamp at gramercy park , right here .
and we might think of these as abandoned .
moreover , we realized that you can start out as being a beaver specialist , but you can look up what an aspen needs .
and we used it to try and reveal a landscape here in act iii .
but i wouldn &apos;t have you think that i don &apos;t like the place on the right , which i quite do . i &apos;ve come to love the city and its kind of diversity , and its resilience , and its dependence on density and how we &apos;re connected together .
you know , about a million years ago , a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees , got a little clever , harnessed fire , invented the printing press , made , you know , luggage with wheels on it .
they &apos;ve been exposed to this idea of our society , of our prosperity . and they may not want to live exactly like us .
if we can change the dynamic , by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ...
we could just re-label things .
well , the first thing we need is , we need leapfrogging .
so it &apos;s not , you know , bollywood isn &apos;t just answering hollywood . right ?
i would keep your eye on this fellow .
here &apos;s a design for harvesting rainwater that &apos;s super cheap and available to people in the developing world .
and as they grow up , they will grow up around the mines , their roots will detect the chemicals in them , and where the flowers turn red you don &apos;t step .
and policing copyright violations for children &apos;s birthday cakes was such a hassle that the college bakery said , &quot; you know what , we &apos;re getting out of that business .
because it turned out we &apos;re not really couch potatoes .
so in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits , the dmca also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices .
imagine this sign everywhere -- except imagine it doesn &apos;t say college bakery , imagine it says youtube and facebook and twitter .
they just want the sharing to go away .
it changed my life .
&quot; what are you doing here ?
so the college works following the lifestyle and workstyle of mahatma gandhi .
i asked a forester -- high-powered , paper-qualified expert -- i said , &quot; what can you build in this place ? &quot;
it &apos;s a parabolic scheffler solar cooker .
she has a cabinet , a minister of education , a minister for energy , a minister for health .
men are restless , men are ambitious , men are compulsively mobile , and they all want a certificate .
and they haven &apos;t collapsed .
i knew which woman i would like to take .
don &apos;t listen to the world bank , listen to the people on the ground .
and it &apos;s our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful .
so they &apos;re singing to you .
dan gilbert , author of stumbling on happiness , challenges the idea that we ’ ll be miserable if we don ’ t get what we want . our &quot; psychological immune system &quot; lets us feel truly happy even when things don ’ t go as planned .
interestingly , there are data on these two groups of people , data on how happy they are .
and here are three guys synthesizing happiness . &quot; i am so much better off physically , financially , emotionally , mentally and almost every other way . &quot; &quot; i don &apos;t have one minute &apos;s regret . it was a glorious experience . &quot; &quot; i believe it turned out for the best . &quot; who are these characters who are so damn happy ?
what are these terms ?
i &apos;ll take number three . &quot; we explained we would have number three mailed to them .
you find a way to be happy with what &apos;s happened .
hello ? 66 percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture .
&quot; hey , ma , i got to talk to you . &quot;
great story is the art of letting go .
and i was calling about how to make ajiaco . it &apos;s a cuban meal .
and this is the woman that wants me to come on a saturday morning when i have a lot to do , but it doesn &apos;t take long because cuban guilt is a weighty thing .
&quot; oh , my god . &quot; i said , &quot; ok , fine . does pop know you &apos;re driving ? &quot;
&quot; yeah . and you haven &apos;t been stopped ? &quot;
but that doesn &apos;t happen most of the time , right ?
&quot; look , the chevy -- he &apos;s coming this way . &quot;
you know , she eats small portions .
i finally come -- and now , it &apos;s the south .
now , some of them you &apos;ve got to make up , people .
it &apos;s a half-whisper , &quot; god , i miss her . &quot;
we have a rocketmavericks.com website with my photos if you want to learn more about this , participate , be a spectator .
and in many ways , i try to capture the mishaps ; it &apos;s the challenge in photography when these things all take place in a fraction of a second .
what zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas
it required that it was completely trivial : that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car , go get it , drive it .
and that &apos;s persisted for the four years in which they &apos;ve been doing congestion pricing .
and this is a moment from &quot; the graduate . &quot; do you remember this moment ?
they &apos;re resilient ; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design .
we have this incredible excess capacity .
and they got here in the late 1960s .
i was going through a lot of personal problems at the time .
i was like , that sounds totally fake .
the second &quot; a &quot; is awareness .
in his deeply authentic self , he also loved needlepoint .
so i wanted to ask them to , if they don &apos;t mind , stand up .
and when we did , my dad would say , &quot; can you believe someone climbed a tree over there , picked this thing off it , put it in a truck , drove it all the way to the docks and then sailed it all the way across the atlantic ocean and then put it in another truck and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house , so they could sell it to us for 25 cents ? &quot;
thank you .
unlike the grand canyon or the washington monument , people come here to see what &apos;s no longer there .
ka : were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants -- suddenly fulfilling needs ?
so rick and liz and kevin and i came up with the idea .
but this was a half a million dollar project ?
ka : sort of like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little stonehenge , i guess ?
dr : well here &apos;s the issue :
and a day or two before it opened was giuliani &apos;s farewell address , where he proposed the idea of all of ground zero being a memorial .
so yeah , i think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities .
it &apos;s 350 people on the committee for oklahoma city , which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc , spontaneous solution that expanded on union square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already .
and then , finally , all suited up for the 90-minute drive to copper mountain .
how do we know that legislation that would require that they be pulled from play , cleared for return to play , applies to them ?
if only .
maybe offer to spearhead a fundraiser to buy new gear --
in the 19th century , it was a corrupt politician .
here &apos;s another interesting truth about the doodle : people who doodle when they &apos;re exposed to verbal information retain more of that information than their non-doodling counterparts .
wolfgang kessling : how to air-condition outdoor spaces
so if i overlay , and if you overlay all these comfort envelopes , what we see is , in all these places , air temperature has been ranging something from 25 to 35 , and if you go on the line , 30 , of 30 degrees c ambient temperatures . if you go along that line you see there has been all kind of comfort , all kinds of perceived outdoor comfort , ranging from very comfortable to very uncomfortable .
they can adjust and find their comfort they need to find .
shukran .
and so i suddenly realized two very simple things :
how much clustering is there ?
another more subtle possibility is that they start gaining weight , and it changes your ideas of what an acceptable body size is .
now , when looked at this , it changed the way i see things , because this thing , this network that &apos;s changing across time , it has a memory , it moves , things flow within it , it has a kind of consistency -- people can die , but it doesn &apos;t die ; it still persists --
maybe , in fact , emotions have a collective existence , not just an individual existence .
now , those people both have four friends , but a &apos;s friends all know each other , and b &apos;s friends do not .
how does this help us understand ?
similarly , social networks are required for the spread of good and valuable things , like love and kindness and happiness and altruism and ideas .
they &apos;re here , getting better and better every day .
it &apos;s not really a conscious decision ,
because , if you haven &apos;t noticed from my skin color , i &apos;m white , and that is a huge barrier on a native reservation .
i want to repeat that part .
sign the paper , or no food for your tribe .
with this event , a new era in native american history began .
the tuberculosis rate on pine ridge is approximately eight times higher than the u.s. national average .
because the solution seems so far in the past , i needed nothing short of a time machine to access them .
they lack nutrients , and diarrhea dehydrates them .
and this what i want to think of as the disconcerting thing , what i want to call &quot; the last mile &quot; problem .
it &apos;s not just medicine .
now , diarrhea &apos;s interesting because it &apos;s been around for thousands of years , ever since humankind really lived side by side enough to have really polluted water .
it &apos;s more complex than that .
here &apos;s what i &apos;m going to do : i &apos;m going to put objects on the screen .
i &apos;ll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion .
if we want to encourage change of behavior , gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness .
this is a typical insulin injection .
and you want to think about the social value of that in terms of carbon offsets , reduced electricity , 900 million dollars per year .
i mean , it sometimes feels , listening to behavioral economists that they are kind of putting into place academically , what great marketers have sort of intuitively known for a long time .
these are inflatable monkeys in every city in scotland : &quot; everybody always thinks they are right . &quot; they were combined in the media .
if it &apos;s -- see it for a long enough time , i actually do something about it .
and this is nothing new .
and we can start talking about things like electrical load .
do you agree ?
good . nice . and you can sit over there .
so i think , number three , i have arranged them in a full house . with queens and -- it &apos;s ok --
here , i can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush .
direct in the right brain , that &apos;s much better . and so -- -- arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing .
just push them through , good . thank you .
ok . another person . oh , i forgot , i shouldn &apos;t shuffle but i think -- -- actually , my technique is to peek , all the time .
and you &apos;ll say stop , anywhere . got it ?
the false count -- and the number one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight -- you say the same card all the time .
yeah , good .
there was the place . and here is king of spades , correct ?
i think we have it now . yeah , good , good .
and it was ok . one more ?
yeah , good .
yeah , i do this . i know where it is , because i peeked before and then i do this .
touch me , feel -- ah , ah , you know !
what actually happened was the impulses were reduced .
and you have cds in your car , and you go to the symphony .
you have a fantastic ear . everybody has a fantastic ear . so nobody is tone-deaf .
so we have b , a , g , f. and if we have b , a , g , f , what do we expect next ? oh , that might have been a fluke .
so this is a piece which goes from away to home .
and one of them came to me the next morning and he said , &quot; you know , i &apos;ve never listened to classical music in my life , but when you played that shopping piece ... &quot;
that &apos;s a totally different world .
now , in america law is a professional degree : you get your university degree , then you go on to law school .
and eventually , after five or 10 minutes , most people figure out the solution , which you can see here .
and it does just the opposite .
if-then rewards work really well for those sorts of tasks , where there is a simple set of rules and a clear destination to go to .
this is not a philosophy .
no . these are economists from mit , from carnegie mellon , from the university of chicago .
in the 20th century , we came up with this idea of management .
why ? because you have to deliver something overnight .
and i say , &quot; nope . i have proof . &quot;
and here &apos;s the best part . here &apos;s the best part . we already know this . the science confirms what we know in our hearts .
except there is a slight tether here , which keeps it from going over the top of its field .
and it &apos;s floating . and this is in france .
this is a clock i designed .
so it can see its environment , and then it can mimic its environment and disappear .
okay . thank you .
now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
and as we &apos;re coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary .
they are all , you know , warming up and doing stuff .
in tel aviv they come to my concerts . &quot;
let &apos;s see somebody else , a great conductor . riccardo muti , please .
three years ago he got a letter signed by all 700 employees of la scala , musical employees , i mean the musicians , saying , &quot; you &apos;re a great conductor . we don &apos;t want to work with you . please resign . &quot;
did you see this kind of movement ? let me conduct you . twice .
oh yeah . he says , &quot; you start when you can &apos;t stand it anymore . &quot;
and you become a partner building the rollercoaster ,
now something else .
you know why ? because the meaning of the music is pain .
my work , for a long time , has been involved in education , in teaching people practical skills for sustainability ,
but of those , 65 have already passed their peak .
and in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually feasible .
the idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology .
some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects , like community-supported agriculture schemes , urban food production , creating local food directories , and so on . a lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies , community-owned energy companies , where the community can invest money into itself , to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need .
because i think stories are vital here .
now out of that pie , the government spends 36 percent .
now he &apos;s put together some thoughts : about half of that he &apos;ll cut , another half , perhaps in a very complex set of steps , taxes will be approved .
the forecast for the medical piece alone is to go from 26 percent of the budget to 42 percent .
it &apos;s sort of the voters . it &apos;s sort of us showing up .
so we need these pieces .
this is the theme of my talk today .
when you have a conversation like this , the kid has to come up with the next thing to say to be responsible for what he started .
in other words , it &apos;s useless .
they don &apos;t draw to sell the work to a client or play the piano to earn money for the family .
but such a teacher is seldom found .
we want to express , to reveal ourselves , but with the artist dead , the artistic desire reveals itself in dark form .
right now , we need to start our own art .
the really good writing i &apos;ve seen in my class was not from the assignments with a long deadline , but from the 40- to 60-minute crazy writing students did in front of me with a pencil .
so i asked the driver , &quot; what is this ? &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
they had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars and over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water .
so in these plans , we had about 657 plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings .
but the ninth largest retailer , the ninth biggest retailer in the world today is aldi , and it offers you only 1,400 products -- one kind of canned tomato sauce .
because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
it also gets me excited about this big product that i &apos;m putting together , so i &apos;m more willing to be motivated to be engaged .
its changes will affect all of humanity .
over the next few years i was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies , while still researching the physics of climate change .
yet , there was more energy coming in than going out .
where you are sitting now would be under water .
this fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations , creating millions of jobs .
at his day job , steve truglia flips cars , walks through fire and falls out of buildings -- pushing technology to make stunts bigger , safer , more awesome . he talks us through his next stunt : the highest jump ever attempted , from the very edge of space .
he worked with john wayne and most of those old punch-ups you see in the westerns . yakima was either there or he stunt coordinated .
not today .
you should hear some of the phone conversations that i have with people on my bluetooth in the shop .
not the cardboard box , but the green screen .
there were three jumps .
this is him in his old rock-and-roll jeans there , pushing him in , those turned up jeans .
that &apos;s in new mexico .
your blood tries to boil . it &apos;s called vaporization .
i think it &apos;s a great challenge .
and the third part of this is that we &apos;ve all agreed , nonetheless , on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation . i mean , sirena last night was a marvel , wasn &apos;t she ? just seeing what she could do .
they just switched , that was it .
to william shakespeare , &quot; and put the pencil down .
if you were to visit education , as an alien , and say &quot; what &apos;s it for , public education ? &quot;
and the consequence is that many highly talented , brilliant , creative people think they &apos;re not , because the thing they were good at at school wasn &apos;t valued , or was actually stigmatized .
i say , &quot; terry , please , i &apos;m trying to fry an egg in here . give me a break . &quot;
and for the future , it won &apos;t serve us .
it &apos;s still going strong , with positive press to die for .
let &apos;s just say &quot; value for money . &quot;
and notice two of them are wearing headscarves , and yes , even they can laugh .
for inspiration , go to one of our festivals , go online , drop us a line .
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i &apos;ve won .
i like to smile and say , &quot; thank you . &quot; thursday : confidence is key .
and i &apos;m not a trained academic . neither am i a veteran social worker .
and that rooftop did not have any ceiling , only half a tin sheet .
shukla bose : well , that girl that you saw , her father sells flowers on the roadside .
we want to continue with this program and extend it to all our other schools .
such beautiful food ,
he was begging by a bus stop a few years ago , got picked up and is now in an orphanage , has been coming to school for the last four and a half months .
but i was thinking about this , and i realized that although my new book makes me happy , and i think would make my mother happy , it &apos;s not really about happiness .
they think , well , you know , figuring out what people think about cola &apos;s not that easy .
then the next person came to him , and that was campbell &apos;s soup .
howard doesn &apos;t believe that there is such a thing .
as howard loves to say , &quot; the mind knows not what the tongue wants . &quot;
it &apos;s to make them turn their back on what they think they like now , and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy .
italian tomato sauce is what ? it &apos;s blended ; it &apos;s thin .
if i were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a type of coffee , a brew -- that made all of you happy , and then i asked you to rate that coffee , the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 .
you don &apos;t have the pustules or the redness and inflammation .
but i have some good news for you , because i &apos;m a journalist , i like to end things in a happy way or a forward-thinking way .
i went to medical school , and i didn &apos;t have a course called how to think skeptically , or how not to order tests .
&lt; transcript &gt;
right , it &apos;s true .
and it &apos;s that third one , especially , where visions of the future begin to manifest themselves .
and there &apos;s also a balance between the visible and the invisible in comics .
and i found my personal answer for this in those ancient comics that i was showing you .
it will adapt . it will
now , i &apos;ve got a story for you .
even as a child , i remember thinking that what i really wanted most in life was to be able to understand everything and then to communicate it to everyone else .
here was a palin impersonator quoting palin word for word .
why is this remotely controversial ?
and joel was explaining to me that , because usa today was one of america &apos;s four papers of record , it would be scanned by virtually everyone in attendance at the conference , which meant that , if he hit it out of the park with his cartoon on monday , the opening day of the conference , it could get passed around at the highest level among actual decision-makers .
jok church : a circle of caring
and watched over her family , because it was necessary . it &apos;s something we knew how to do .
being solemn is easy .
perfection happens during solemn play .
and to do stuff that wasn &apos;t made out of helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it .
and in that moment of desire and focus , he can win .
here &apos;s an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called &quot; mind games . &quot;
donors &apos; walls made out of lucite .
so i began doing this crazy presentation of these installations -- potential installations -- on these underpass bridges , and stood up in front of the city council -- and was a little bit scared , i have to admit .
somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery , and i had a first show about two-and-a-half years ago , and i showed these paintings that i &apos;m showing you now .
they don &apos;t like that . they think it &apos;s crank . i don &apos;t think it &apos;s crank .
but as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that &apos;s 28 times per second .
this piece , actually , will be on display down in the sierra simulcast lounge in the breaks between now and the end of the show .
now this is typically how you see sunfish , this is where they get their common name .
600 million . now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby , and you had to feed this thing .
i think donne wrote a poem about that .
i mean what other kind of fish , if you approach it right , will say , &quot; okay , scratch me right there . &quot;
as the sun comes up , you see in the blue , they start their dive .
you just don &apos;t hear that every day .
one day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest .
so , indra arrived , and performed the sacrifice of the horse .
and it reaches somewhere where other things don &apos;t .
and the mncs give them machines that they cannot afford .
man : one , two , three , four folds we make .
from your beginnings in africa , through each generation , may be passed on to you , in your creation . it &apos;s a secret urge , hiding deep in you .
and when , onscreen , crystal got breast cancer , 75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done .
he announced a swayamvara .
last year , i told you the story , in seven minutes , of project orion , which was this very implausible technology that technically could have worked , but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened . so it didn &apos;t happen . it was a dream that did not happen .
and then we jump to von neumann , 1945 , when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing .
so we both go back to the birth of this thing .
this is the archetype of the hard disk that &apos;s in your machine now .
&quot; damn it , i can be just as stubborn as this thing . &quot;
i know when i &apos;m licked . &quot;
and he published it . it wasn &apos;t locked up and disappeared .
so , when i went into these archives looking at this stuff , lo and behold , the archivist came up one day , saying , &quot; i think we found another box that had been thrown out . &quot;
von neumann saw how you could build the machines --
aunties , uncles , you can continue to
we need it . the time is now .
the daughter there , katie , she &apos;s four years old .
well , modern-day life .
jo : yes you are . you are .
they have scissors in the classroom , but knives and forks ? no .
they &apos;ll be having two bottles . ok ?
it cannot just come from one source .
under the circumstances , it &apos;s profoundly important that every single american child leaves school knowing how to cook 10 recipes that will save their life .
it &apos;s free cooking lessons , guys , free cooking lessons in the main street .
&lt; transcript &gt;
they claim that they are battling a dastardly conspiracy .
and they are doing some fantastic research into the characteristics , into the abilities and the socialization of hackers .
the purchaser would send the administrative officer some dollars digitally , and the vendor would sell the stolen credit card details .
then we have renukanth subramaniam , aka jilsi -- founder of darkmarket , born in colombo , sri lanka .
one of the smartest people i &apos;ve ever met .
but all of the people who i &apos;ve spoken to who have fallen foul of the law , they have all said , &quot; please , please give us a chance to work in the legitimate industry .
and that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore , again , because of our development patterns .
they &apos;re the other big generation .
other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes , as universities , and as all variety of office space .
here is the site in 1940 :
they &apos;re easy to be re-adapted .
but densification is not going to work everywhere .
it &apos;s a little extreme , but we &apos;ve got a little water problem .
ben dunlap talks about a passionate life
he had been born in 1903 in the provinces of the old austro-hungarian empire , in what later would become yugoslavia .
and there , mr. teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success , especially after he invented the process for manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit .
do you have any other questions ? &quot;
i delivered a lecture in which i described history as , on the whole , a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality , and mr. teszler came up to me afterwards with gentle reproach and said , &quot; you know , doctor , human beings are fundamentally good . &quot;
mr. milliken said it was not . dr. robicsek disagreed .
it needed a context , a culture , a community of other vaginas .
in westchester they call it a &quot; pooky , &quot; in new jersey a &quot; twat . &quot;
and it happens logically and organically and truthfully .
it has taken me to juarez , mexico , where i was a week ago , where i have literally been there in parking lots where bones of women have washed up and been dumped next to coca-cola bottles .
and at that time we did this extraordinary v-day at madison square garden where we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome , 18,000 people standing up to say &quot; yes &quot; to vaginas , which was really a pretty incredible transformation .
and everyone was supposed to be happy in that community and , in fact , my life was hell . i lived with an alcoholic father who beat me and molested me , and it was all inside that .
but he was a passionate teacher , and i remember one of our earlier classes with him , he was projecting images on the wall , asking us to think about them , and he put up an image of a painting .
and in about 1997 , the then-director philippe de montebello gave me the go-ahead to organize an exhibition for 2002 . we normally have these very long lead-in times .
and in this extraordinary setting , the costumes were like actors and actresses , or living sculptures .
i want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind , where they &apos;re prepared to be a little bit lost , to explore , to see the unfamiliar in the familiar , or to try the unknown .
but sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses , and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them .
dm : as my mother said , we are the future hope , and the men are only killing in somalia .
when the war broke out -- civil war -- i saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help , and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in somalia and help the women and children .
and really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and i can do it .
i &apos;m going to take you on a 16-minute trip on 72 percent of the planet , so buckle up .
we are always , constantly playing the zero sum game .
because it &apos;s along the axis of the mid-ocean ridge where the great crustal plates are separating .
it was hot . it wasn &apos;t hot enough .
we did not know about this life system .
again , you know , we stop at the water &apos;s edge .
we expect to start hauling out the bodies in perfect condition with their dna .
but then it &apos;s connected through internet too -- the new internet highway that makes internet one look like a dirt road on the information highway -- with 10 gigabits of bandwidth .
watching exploration live from thousands of miles away , and it &apos;s just dawning on her what she &apos;s seeing .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
&quot; don &apos;t use big words . &quot;
and we &apos;re laughing doubly then because he &apos;s the body , but it &apos;s also -- voice offstage : richard .
i was so fascinated by that oxygen commercial .
&quot; for sale : white trash compactor . &quot;
and i was sort of , as i was starting to analyze what exactly it is that i do , i read a book called &quot; trickster makes this world , &quot; by lewis hyde .
you &apos;re young . i &apos;m old . who &apos;s going to see it ?
you know , the toes of the gecko , curling and uncurling like the fingers of michael moschen .
and the daughter says , as tactfully as possible , &quot; mom , are you aware that you just went through two red lights ? &quot;
thank you very much . &lt; / transcript &gt;
so let &apos;s start . number 10 : we lose the will to survive .
it &apos;s becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe , and probably fairly close to us , is a fairly remote idea .
somewhere in the amazon forest is the marginal tree .
they are expecting to create little , tiny black holes .
when the starlink disaster happened , there was a battle between the epa and the fda over who really had authority , and over what parts of this , and they didn &apos;t get it straightened out for months . that &apos;s kind of crazy .
start terraforming mars . this is one of my favorite subjects . i wrote a story about this in life magazine in 1993 .
we have a real , major outbreak of disease in the united states , we are not prepared to cope with it .
it had the effect of about 1,000 hiroshima bombs .
but it &apos;s going to take them 10 years , at spending three million dollars a year , and even then , they claim they &apos;ll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued .
the worst thing we can do is say , jeez , i got enough to worry about without worrying about an asteroid .
i hope it will be .
this is very , very important because this is the system , this is the crucible , out of which life on the planet came ,
now you &apos;ve heard of hydrothermal vents , but the other discovery is that deep below the sea floor , there is vast reservoir of microbial activity , which we have only just discovered and we have almost no way to study .
it &apos;s a new world .
it &apos;ll be , in a sense , like having time on a telescope , except you &apos;ll have your own port .
so what can we actually do tomorrow ?
delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean will dramatically accelerate adaptation .
he won the nobel prize for literature in 1948 .
some of the ice in the icebergs that i photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
but to create a space that never existed is what interests me ;
and today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us .
it is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of , and a story that is certainly ongoing .
so the important thing actually , is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions , which might be totally inexplicable in words ,
so i do believe that architecture as i see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have , in every intimacy that we possess .
so the unexpected is always unexpected .
so i believe that my main interest is to memory .
you know it costs a lot of money and so on , but yes , it should not play it safe .
so democracy , as difficult as it is , i believe in it .
i came from the bronx . i was taught not to be a loser ,
a himba is one of the 29 ethnic groups in namibia .
then in the same time , around 1980 , we had a very big drought . it killed almost everything that was left .
at every himba village , there is a sacred fire .
they have also given funding for two decades to this whole program .
secondly , we put it for infrastructure . food .
so what do we call this ?
the problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves .
there &apos;s been a lot of movement recently in greening our food systems .
shellfish , mussels , oysters , clams , tilapia , char -- these were the common species .
it &apos;s like a hangover from protein .
there is great confusion when the two look at each other .
so , having seen all of this in the course of a 30-year career , i was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago , because i thought the story of climate change was based on computer models .
we just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago all across the northern hemisphere , watching what &apos;s happened .
in the past hundred years , the temperature of the earth has gone up 1.3 degrees fahrenheit , .75 degrees celsius , and it &apos;s going to keep going up because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere .
this is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do -- you put some cheesy illustration on your shot , right ? -- and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points .
if you line up 295 of those nose to tail , that &apos;s about how far back that was .
it &apos;s flowing out to the atlantic ocean on the left .
and that &apos;s where i think organizations like ted , like the extreme ice survey can have a terrific impact on human perception and bring us along .
to four in the morning i can find .
by his own writing , this man was either asleep , at a prayer meeting with al and tipper or learning how to launch
what electric fields are are a field of forces .
and they will either enter into this so-called cellular suicide , programmed cell death , or they will form unhealthy daughter cells and enter into apoptosis once they have divided .
and the typical patient with optimal therapy survives just a little over a year , and only about seven months from the time that the cancer is first treated and then comes back and starts growing again .
first of all , these electrodes are noninvasive .
i &apos;m going to show you another clip of a woman named lydia .
so , first , a small housekeeping announcement : please switch off your proper english check programs installed in your brain .
the waterproofing is done perfectly , better than our city contractors , because not a single drop should go waste in this .
it can envy many municipalities , the color , the taste , the purity of this water .
so , this was the terminal point for silk route .
but the nearest would be &quot; glory , &quot; a reputation .
it is a structure for maintain , for centuries , by generations , without any department , without any funding ,
so , look at the beauty from the desert society who can harvest rainwater , and also create something through a tire from a jet plane , and used in a camel cart .
ted fellow and journalist evgeny morozov punctures what he calls &quot; ipod liberalism &quot; -- the assumption that tech innovation always promotes freedom , democracy -- with chilling examples of ways the internet helps oppressive regimes stifle dissent .
and again , i think this is kind of false .
but then authorities did something very smart .
right ? so they can go online and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020 .
so the way i tend to think of it is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space ,
it didn &apos;t matter what she was crying about , she could get on my knee , she could snot my sleeve up , just cry , cry it out .
my mother , my sister , my auntie , they all get out , but my father and i stayed in the limousine ,
he was being raised by his grandmother .
women are objects , especially sexual objects .
and i zip my pants up in front of them , and i head for the door .
in fact , the american publishers of my book , &quot; the elephant , the tiger and the cell phone , &quot; added a gratuitous subtitle saying , &quot; india : the next 21st-century power . &quot;
india has more all-news tv channels than any country in the world , in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together .
you know , if you visit friends in the suburbs of delhi , on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart that looks like it was designed in the 16th century , wielding a coal-fired steam iron that might have been invented in the 18th century .
she &apos;s illiterate , so she can &apos;t read the french subtitles .
this can sometimes have unintended consequences . ok .
it was essentially india being itself .
we have to overcome our poverty . we have to deal with the hardware of development , the ports , the roads , the airports , all the infrastructural things we need to do , and the software of development , the human capital , the need for the ordinary person in india to be able to have a couple of square meals a day , to be able to send his or her children to a decent school , and to aspire to work a job that will give them opportunities in their lives that can transform themselves .
you literally put it on your skin , and you don &apos;t have to bathe .
kary mullis &apos; next-gen cure for killer infections
it &apos;s like this very fast , very efficient way to get people off the street .
and they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong .
so then there &apos;s also my favorite example of suspended animation .
doctors have a saying that , in fact , &quot; you &apos;re not dead until you &apos;re warm and dead . &quot;
and so , we were thinking about that , about this relationship between these things , and thinking about whether or not that &apos;s what happened to the skier .
it &apos;s an extraordinarily toxic thing .
now , in this state of de-animation , it could not go out dancing , but it was not dead , and it was not harmed .
i want to mention that , first of all , my wife , without whom this talk and my work would not be possible , so thank you very much .
do you know of any car that didn ’ t have a maker ? yes / no .
we became bald-bodied , oddly enough ; for one reason or another , they didn ’ t .
it ’ s a neural system that ’ s wired up to reward the brain for doing a grubby clerical job .
before founding ideo , david said that what he wanted to do was to form a company where all the employees are my best friends .
i want to see how many of you can get these things on the stage .
well , at least , we did once .
okay . put down your pencils , as they say .
he gave each of them some mescaline , and had them listen to some nice , relaxing music for a while .
well , it sort of turns out that we need rules to help us break the old rules and norms that otherwise we might bring to the creative process .
often by bringing lots of found elements together in order to get to a solution .
but what about designing something that isn ’ t physical ?
and so they grabbed some very simple materials , you can see , and did this role-play , this kind of very crude role-play , just to get a sense of what it would be like for passengers if they were stuck in quite small places on airplanes .
when kids play tea party , or they play cops and robbers , they ’ re following a script that they ’ ve agreed to .
because it ’ s very easy to fall into the trap that these states are absolute .
i can just sit back and relax . &quot;
and he put me on anti-depressants .
because that is not only how we achieve success , it &apos;s how we sustain it .
and so i figured for mexico and babes , i could do just about anything .
so i wrote on my blog , &quot; omg omg . &quot;
and scott aggregated all of the videos .
beau awtin : ♫ safe in bed ♫ ew : and our goal -- it was sort of an arbitrary goal -- there was an mtv video where they all sang &quot; lollipop &quot; and they got people from all over the world to just sing that little melody .
it doesn &apos;t matter the technology .
just like today .
and it &apos;s a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education , and in doing so , we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes .
but to me , the most exciting part of it is the data that we &apos;re gathering .
and so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack .
and so what we did is , we took a look at these videos , and we measured how fast the limb was moving to get back to that original question .
and it &apos;s surrounded by membranous areas . and those membranous areas suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure .
that &apos;s a bit long , but it is sort of interesting .
so now , you &apos;d expect a second peak for other reasons , but not half a millisecond later .
and these animals may very well be making use of not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring , but the extremes of the fluid dynamics . and they might actually be making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail .

if i held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth , and i held up another square that was the root two square -- so it ’ s 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans ; and i said , what is the relative value of these two things ?
it generates all of the buoyancy , all of the payload for the craft , and the batteries are down here hanging underneath , exactly like a balloon .
i don ’ t know of any other submersible , or even remote , that just takes advantage that this is a three-dimensional space .
and then by moving through the water it ’ s able to take that control .
you see the larger wing area here .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
if you look here at this map , showing everything in blue is out in the water , and everything in yellow is upland .
so again , we got the short end of the deal there .
so you can imagine scuba diving here .
no , what i want to do is take you back to 1854 in london for the next few minutes , and tell the story -- in brief -- of this outbreak , which in many ways , i think , helped create the world that we live in today , and particularly the kind of city that we live in today .
and so one of the founding moments of public health in the 19th century effectively poisoned the water supply of london much more effectively than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing .
this guy , henry whitehead , who was a local minister , who was not at all a man of science , but was incredibly socially connected ;
and so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map .
and he spent 33 years in prison .
and i usually hand out polaroids when i do these , because i &apos;m setting up lights , and checking my lights , and when i showed her her polaroid , she screamed and ran into her tent .
and her tribe has had to move three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills .
i think this is so necessary in our world today as you see these clash of beliefs taking place .
the other thing : i wanted to give indigenous people a voice .
how did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped , and so forth ?
we draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it .
and then you see this sort of model area around the outside , and that is the radiation coming from the big bang , which is actually incredibly uniform .
now i &apos;m going to show you this in 3d .
there &apos;s a more complicated process going on here .
this one we &apos;re zooming in on is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region .
and we &apos;re going to fly around , and we &apos;ll fly around , and you &apos;ll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect , and you get a large cluster of galaxies .
and this is a simple one , because it doesn &apos;t have the ordinary matter and it just has the dark matter in it .
geology has these effects , which is moving the plates around and so forth .
in fact , we spend more time looking after our cars , our clothes and our hair than we
my own way of dealing with it was to become a monk .
it &apos;s a very uncomfortable way to live life , when you get this tight and stressed .
that &apos;s the potential of meditation , of mindfulness .
so if the field &apos;s been around for so long , why so few clinical advances ?
so they know what to do . the cells genetically know what to do , and they start beating together .
you can hold it like a liver , but it has no cells ; it &apos;s just a skeleton of the liver .
patients are dying every day because we don &apos;t have enough of those organs to go around .
i &apos;m going to share with you a clip in terms of technology we have had in patients now for a while .
and saved my life .
and i did know how the alumni of various schools back in the 30s judged coaches and athletic teams .
and i think that character is much more important than what you are perceived to be .
but yet again i may . and later i may say , i knew him once , and he was weak , or strong , or bold or proud or gay .
most of them are young , you know , and probably newly married .
and i say to you , in whatever you &apos;re doing , you must be patient . you have to have patience to -- we want things to happen . we talk about our youth being impatient a lot .
of hoping when our dreams are dead ;
i liked our -- as a basketball coach at ucla i liked our practices to be the journey , and the game would be the end . the end result .
neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well .
but let &apos;s face it , when you &apos;ve watched it once maybe , or twice , you don &apos;t really want to watch it again , because you know how jack bauer is going to defeat the terrorists .
what i find fascinating is that we &apos;ve actually wired our world to share , whether that &apos;s our neighborhood , our school , our office , or our facebook network ,
all of this was going through my head towards the end of 2008 , when , of course , the great financial crash happened .
it &apos;s one of those ideas that &apos;s so simple , yet brilliant , you wonder why it &apos;s never been done before .
in other words , the car addicts had lost their urge to own .
it &apos;s a new social currency , so to speak , that could become as powerful as our credit rating .
i &apos;m a phd student at mit , and i happen to study atmospheric science .
we don &apos;t need any more freezers .
mo : so we decided to build them -- a recovery in a box , something that could be deployed after every disaster by any local organizer .
now that expense can be huge , but if the town can mobilize x amount of volunteers for y hours , the dollar value of that labor used goes toward the town &apos;s contribution .
there are over three volunteer groups working almost every day , and have been since june 1st of last year , to make sure that these residents get what they need and get back in their homes .
so , i had been there almost three months , and i was touring around the city going to different squatter areas and julius was tagging along , and he was bug eyed and at certain points we were walking around , he grabbed my hand for support , which is something most kenyans would never consider doing .
1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts with no services , no toilets , no rights .
once you have stayed here , you cannot go back . &apos; he meant back beyond that mountain of trash , back in the legal city , of legal buildings , with legal leases and legal rights .
that &apos;s also in istanbul , turkey .
talk about more plastic bags than plankton . and sometimes they have natural trash-disposal .
this is richard muthama peter , and he is an itinerant street photographer in kibera . he makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood , and the people in the neighborhood , and is a great resource in the community .
and all of a sudden i passed the national examination , found myself in a very beautiful high school in kenya .
and these guys took off , followed the footsteps of the villagers until they found and passed them .
gregory petsko on the coming neurological epidemic
and there ’ s tremendous scope for additional private help here , because the government has dropped the ball on much of this , i ’ m afraid .
if you search for the word &quot; technology , &quot; it was not used until 1952 .
and if we study those hunter-gatherer tribes and the neanderthal , which are very similar to early man ,
the other thing that the early man invented was fire .
it &apos;s continually to reinvent ourselves .
and there are things moving towards greater complexity , moving towards greater diversity , moving towards greater specialization , sentience , ubiquity and most important , evolvability :
when king henry of england died ,
nuclear energy , fission , is really bad idea for bombs .
so that i think technology loves biology ,
and one of them was that so many of my friends that were teaching in city schools were having trouble with their students keeping up at grade level , in their reading and writing in particular .
you &apos;ve gotta sell something .
and we sat . and at 2 : 30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk and it just said , &quot; free tutoring for your english-related and writing-related needs -- just come in , it &apos;s all free . &quot;
and so our interns were actually working at the same tables very often , and shoulder-to-shoulder , computer-next-to-computer with the students .
so that &apos;s partly why the tutor corps grew so fast .
they work under the teacher &apos;s guide , and it &apos;s all in one big room .
and once they achieve that level , once they &apos;ve written at that level , they can never go back .
so all the people i used to know in brooklyn , they said , &quot; well , why don &apos;t we have a place like that here ? &quot;
all the designers , all of the builders , everybody was local , all the time was pro-bono .
so you see everything : it &apos;s exactly as a 7-eleven would be .
if you have any questions , you can ask this guy , who &apos;s our director of national programs . he &apos;ll be on the phone .
acknowledging that god is unknown and unknowable by definition .
now the unchanging god feels a bit cold and indifferent to me .
either god is responsible for the tsunami , or god is not in control .
we cannot afford to pay so much for admission .
in the tsunami , in the victims . in the depth of things .
it needs a profound attentiveness and a patient waiting ,
this is not a story of a nameless someone who lived in some war , who we do not know their hopes , their dreams , their accomplishments , their families , their beliefs , their values .
a palestinian woman once told me , &quot; it is not about the fear of one death , &quot; she said , &quot; sometimes i feel i die 10 times in one day , &quot; as she was describing the marches of soldiers and the sounds of their bullets .
we are missing stories of women who are literally keeping life going in the midst of wars .
there is no way we can talk about the building of stability if we don &apos;t start investing in women and girls .
ideas , language , even the phrase &apos; each other &apos; no longer makes any sense . &quot;
by the way was banned by the fcc ,
and i know there are people here , the younger generation who want to be hippies ,
the creativity that allowed us , that we were required to have to conceive and build and launch the space shuttle , springs from the same source as the imagination and
you know , people say intuitive , you know that &apos;s like you &apos;re in touch with nature ,
it &apos;s kind of a book about questions , questions about simplicity .
so i &apos;m mostly driving along , okay , and then i saw this sign .
but looking way back , when i was a child -- you see , i grew up in a tofu factory in seattle .
and also ikko tanaka was a very important mentor in my life -- the paul rand of japan . he designed most of the major icons of japan , like issey miyake &apos;s brand and also muji .
i did this series of calendars for shiseido .
so , to get off the tree , i began to use my old computers .
i discovered that cheetos are good , expressive material .
you know the uni is the most challenging , so number ten is challenging . people hate number ten like they hate uni , actually .
and so , this whole thing has struck me as exciting to be here , because life is finite .
i &apos;m giving a short slide show this morning that i &apos;m giving for the very first time , so -- well it &apos;s -- i don &apos;t want or need to raise the bar ,
let me show you these slides here .
if it &apos;s more being trapped on the way out , then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here . here is the lower atmosphere .
put a price on carbon . we need a co2 tax , revenue neutral , to replace taxation on employment , which was invented by bismarck -- and some things have changed since the 19th century .
we now have a culture of distraction .
this challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .
a new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge .
the first step we did was to collect . we did 130 different sources of information -- from ngo reports to newspapers and cable news .
this wasn &apos;t supposed to happen .
why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts have the same patterns ?
and the system gets perturbed . it moves upwards to a fragmented state .
but designers are great at taking big revolutions that happen and transforming them so that we can use them .
and it &apos;s really interesting to see how this happens .
then , he took the scans of the best organs and made the meat --
so the idea of collective design is something that will become even bigger in the future ,
it &apos;s a designer that put 10,000 bees at work and they built this vase . they had a particular shape that they had to stay in .
the idea is that when you lose your loved one or you go through a bad breakup , what you miss the most are those annoying things that you used to hate when you were with the other person .
medical ethicist harvey fineberg shows us three paths forward for the ever-evolving human species : to stop evolving completely , to evolve naturally -- or to control the next steps of human evolution , using genetic modification , to make ourselves smarter , faster , better . neo-evolution is within our grasp . what will we do with it ?
the great 20th-century geneticist , t.g. dobzhansky , who was also a communicant in the russian orthodox church , once wrote an essay that he titled &quot; nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution . &quot; now if you are one of those who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution , this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid , take out your personal communications device -- i give you permission -- and perhaps take another look at kathryn schultz &apos;s book on being wrong , because nothing in the rest of this talk is going to make any sense whatsoever to you .
but what will come in the future ?
i wanted to restore health from disease .
they &apos;re , in some cultures , choosing to have more males than females .
why not have the quick twitch muscle that will enable you to run faster and longer ?
the only trouble is the people next door ; i can &apos;t stand them . &quot;
you have to , of course , be aware of the needs of others , but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life and be of help to people .
you know , there &apos;s no way that you can do anything for anyone if you overdo things .
symbolically , what the rabbis say is that at passover , what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride , our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world , and that everything should revolve round us .
he goes in there , and it &apos;s not there .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
in fact , imagine something even worse .
if you hit your thumb with a hammer , these wires in your arm -- that , of course , we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires , new nerves , take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt .
and she &apos;s doing absolutely fantastic .
you can see here , there &apos;s the yucatan peninsula , if you recognize cozumel off the east coast there .
the object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across , so roughly the size of mackey auditorium here .
the smaller ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a millennium , every few centuries or every few thousand years , but it &apos;s still something to be aware of .
250 meters across , so it would do unbelievable damage .
it &apos;s like , well , you can try that , but the problem is timing .
it doesn &apos;t have to be huge -- couple of tons , not that big -- and you park it near the asteroid .
65 million years from now , we don &apos;t have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum .
my story starts -- the story i want to share -- starts in 1991 .
the big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan .
so third meeting , arguments are pretty well exercised .
it &apos;s a kind of very nice , sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper .
we believe that in the last 10 years companies that we &apos;ve financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world .
so what the governor got was an empty shell .
you know , instead of people running in this dark , trying to find their own match , who will be willing , who has the same goals . instead of all of that we thought there is -- something new needs to be invented .
and in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms , no blind people running around to find each other .
though he never would travel to europe , he went with shakespeare &apos;s kings to merry england , he went with lord byron &apos;s poetry to spain and portugal .
he then ran twice for the senate , lost twice .
so he put the pen down .
i was selected as a white house fellow when i was 24 years old .
and he started out , &quot; doris , more than any other woman i have ever known ... &quot;
so deep , for instance , was abraham lincoln &apos;s love of shakespeare , that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater , even during those dark days of the war .
which allows me , from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall , to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work .
he said , &quot; no problem . it wasn &apos;t a religious service . &quot;
thank you for letting me be that storyteller today .
the experiments had to be wrong , and they were .
and he said , here , &quot; it is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws . &quot; the basic law , let &apos;s say -- here &apos;s an assumption .
and so what happens is that the new phenomena , the new skins , the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion that we get to , resemble the slightly larger ones .
but you can just look at the form . you can look at the form .
symmetry exhibits the simplicity .
you don &apos;t need -- you don &apos;t need something more to get something more .
the story begins in the iran-iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of iraq by foreign forces , the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change .
so the hyperbole is not actually surprising .
much more important , it was the first multicultural , multifaith state on a huge scale .
it &apos;s a great 19th century moment .
and the cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan .
and it &apos;s the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means , what cyrus means , but above all , cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- cyrus as the defender of the homeland , the champion , of course , of iranian identity and of the iranian peoples , tolerant of all faiths .
i was basically concerned about what was going on in the world .
there was no day of global unity .
and i rang sir bob ayling , who was ceo of ba at the time , and said , &quot; mate , we &apos;ve got this invitation .
and i &apos;ve always spoken to women and children wherever i &apos;ve gone .
and now i was thinking , &quot; well , the press it really going to hear this story . &quot; and suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day .
and i went back to the u.n. for another couple of years .
i mean , we basically sat down with everybody -- in and out of schools with ministers of education , holding these press conferences , which of course , now were loaded with press , everybody was there .
and then there was this other statement that came out from the u.n. department of security and safety saying that , in afghanistan , because of this work , the violence was down by 70 percent .
so , utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action .
patrick awuah on educating leaders
start all over again .
a ghana airways pilot falls into the same predicament .
and it was brilliant to be part of this team .
this was not the world that i &apos;d want my children to grow up in .
now , a month into this project , we &apos;d just started classes .
it says a lot about her .
alberto cairo : there are no scraps of men
it was a strange sensation .
and then i ask an even more stupid question : &quot; why don &apos;t you have the prostheses ?
we have other things to do . &quot; but they insisted .
we could not possibly stay indoors , with all these sandbags at the windows .
he told me , &quot; he &apos;s at school . he &apos;d doing quite well . &quot; but i understood he wanted to tell me something .
only one week -- one week try and not a single day more .
and you see the faces .
we transport the wheelchairs everywhere .
where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars , all at once , every half hour , and very precisely .
but what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
wrong . i &apos;m not looking at you . i can &apos;t see you .
oh , they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods .
and she didn &apos;t answer the damn question !
and that &apos;s the kind of information they &apos;re going to bring back to you ?
now , montel williams is an intelligent man .
and we haven &apos;t heard from her since . strange .
what is homeopathy ?
and we must do something about those problems .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
those machines go the proverbial junkyard .
35 million surgeries are attempted every year without safe anesthesia .
the only difference is that now you &apos;re only working with 21 percent oxygen .
is this the design that &apos;s going to work in place ?
i worked in a coal mine -- dangerous .
i &apos;m a redundant person .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
so i like the way you roll , sergey brin . no . this is was the problem : transparency -- free from pretense or deceit ; easily detected or seen through ; readily understood ; characterized by visibility or accessibility of information , especially concerning business practices -- that last line being probably the biggest problem .
we will have them geared for both male or female -- solid , roll-on or stick , whatever it may be .
i don &apos;t know .
they &apos;ve helped companies like nestle , febreze , hallmark discover that brand personality .
a : yeah . all right .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , mainly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
i &apos;m not a vegetarian -- this is the old nixon line , right ?
we didn &apos;t know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility .
so , when the usda finally acknowledged that it was plants , rather than animals , that made people healthy , they encouraged us , via their overly simplistic food pyramid , to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day , along with more carbs .
how we got to this place is the history of food in the united states .
from the &apos; 30s on , road systems expanded , trucks took the place of railroads , fresh food began to travel more .
listen to this , between 1950 and 2000 , the world &apos;s population doubled .
sadly , it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma , if not actually killed --
the locavores , the organivores , the vegetarians , the vegans , the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food .
i &apos;ve been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years .
i started a site called treehugger --
on the weekend , your choice .
if i can ask an indiscreet question , how many of you have tattoos ?
myth number two : orpheus , wonderful guy , charming to be around , great partier , great singer , loses his beloved , charms his way into the underworld , only person to charm his way into the underworld , charms the gods of the underworld , they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they &apos;re out .
it seems that there &apos;s not just one person who thinks that these problems are important .
library of congress holds 18 million volumes .
if we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe -- the virgo supercluster -- maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there , but if we go extinct we never will .
we might end up with something like this ,
so in a broad sense , we don &apos;t need to think about technology as only little gadgets , like these things here ,
it &apos;s also interesting to think about what other things are -- so if these all enabled great values , why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be ?
and then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities .
the sun end was about four inches in diameter ,
jh : and they &apos;re non-deterministic .
and i &apos;ll do another session with it and bring it up to another level , where all of this becomes the background , the depth of it .
jh : is that a literal part of the image , or is my eye making that interference pattern --
i mean , i &apos;ve got the symptoms .
my talk is &quot; flapping birds and space telescopes . &quot;
and it raises a question : what changed ?
but if we follow the laws of origami , we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very , very simple ,
but that &apos;s the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump .
what if i want to make something that has a lot of flaps ?
we found we could do insects , spiders , which are close , things with legs , things with legs and wings , things with legs and antennae .
one of the earliest was this pattern , this folded pattern , studied by koryo miura , a japanese engineer .
and it works perfectly on its test range , and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle .
thanks .
so my research has been focused more on -- after finding out these things that actually corresponded to my own experience , i tried to understand : where -- in everyday life , in our normal experience -- do we feel really happy ?
you can &apos;t understand more than two people talking to you .
she is the founder of body shop , the natural cosmetics king .
it &apos;s not very challenging any more .
women , for the first time this year , became the majority of the american workforce .
i was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else , and i started to notice a distinct pattern -- that the recession was affecting men much more deeply than it was affecting women .
now what does that mean ?
you would be issuing orders from above .
and some people say it &apos;s because , in 9th grade , boys start dropping out of school .
and the instructor was up there in the class explaining to them all the ways in which they had lost their identity in this new age .
and now look at the chart .
so the image that i like to think of , instead of glass ceiling , is the high bridge .
fn : and i also had an interest in dangerous inventions .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
the world population has doubled since i went to school .
and i listened to what &apos;s happening in china ,
here i have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children -- big families , small families .
it &apos;s only by child survival that we will stop population growth .
and they were competitive about this : &quot; you pommies , your rates of heart disease are shocking . &quot;
and the evidence for it preventing cancers is not yet great .
and i first off started work in cell culture , growing cells , and then i was using knockout mouse models -- mice that couldn &apos;t make the gene .
a few good things here : this appeared to be more marked in older people .
in winter or summer , it &apos;s the same amount of light .
anthony atala &apos;s state-of-the-art lab grows human organs -- from muscles to blood vessels to bladders , and more . at tedmed , he shows footage of his bio-engineers working with some of its sci-fi gizmos , including an oven-like bioreactor and a machine that &quot; prints &quot; human tissue .
we &apos;ve talked about stem cells tonight .
so , how can we harness that power ?
and that &apos;s what we did for this piece of muscle .
and this is an x-ray showing you the patent , functional blood vessel .
we take the scaffold , we seed it with cells , and you can now see here , the valve leaflets opening and closing .
another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs .
one of the things that i wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we &apos;re going for in regenerative medicine .
but it takes a lot to get there .
thank you for your attention .
i &apos;ll just give you a few examples of the types of ways you can have sex that isn &apos;t standard for male or female .
and it was only when he had reached the age of 19 that he began to have enough medical problems actually from menstruating internally , that doctors figured out that , in fact , he was female internally .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least 95 percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that commonality , we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions .
now in practice they don &apos;t actually test people for their chromosomes .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and i &apos;ve never spoken about this ever , until now -- so this is the first time anyone &apos;s ever heard it , except my wife three days ago , because she said , &quot; what are you talking about ? &quot; and i told her -- is that i think we miss an opportunity to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits , and to groom them or show them that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing .
if you teach a man to fish , you feed him for a lifetime . &quot;
attention deficit disorder , bipolar disorder .
and we &apos;ve heard those things about &quot; is it nurture or is it nature , &quot; right ?
and i remember this one customer so vividly because i also did some other stuff with these clients .
i also learned , don &apos;t reveal your source , because i got beat up after about four weeks of doing this because one of the rich kids found out where i was buying my comics from , and he didn &apos;t like the fact that he was paying a lot more .
and you could stuff pins in them .
and they &apos;d give me their orders for the following week .
so i sold lots and lots of sunglasses .
they go around looking for what it is .
when you see grumpy customer service , point that out to them .
these skills are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom
but for me , unlike them , in my world , the slate was not clean ,
this aversion to social values may seem at odds with the explosion of community service programs .
we may be at the top of the list when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth .
in the language of my students , &quot; deep thought matters when you &apos;re contemplating what to do about things that matter . &quot;
we intend to turn the intellectual and imaginative power , passion and boldness of our students , faculty and staff to developing strategies for acting on the critical challenges of our time .
and i &apos;m at a stage in life where i &apos;m yearning for my old days , so i want to confess to you that when i was a kid , indeed , i was a conservative .
and i &apos;m not talking about the god thing .
okay , so julian made this video .
js : one remix is about individuals using our shared culture as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience .
but apparently , no brains existed in this place when democrats passed and signed this bill into law .
these tools that we built enable this sharing in parts through licenses that make it clear and a freedom to create without requiring permission first because the permission has already been granted and a respect for the creator because it builds upon a copyright the creator has licensed freely .
it is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom we should be encouraging .
everything is covered in invisible ecosystems made of tiny lifeforms : bacteria , viruses and fungi .
but if you look across these space types , you can see that they &apos;re fundamentally different from one another .
he went from thinking just about energy to also starting to think about human health .
in fact , they make their livings on this kind of stuff . i &apos;m going to try and save you all the time and all the money and go through it in the next three minutes , so bear with me .
the idea was , &quot; vote your conscience , &quot; vote for mister splashy pants .
it &apos;s okay to take yourself a little less seriously , given that , even though it &apos;s a very serious cause , you could ultimately achieve your final goal .
a computer in those days was something the secret services used to use for code breaking .
but spin on to the 80s when personal computers did arrive , then there was room for this kind of system on personal computers .
in the next couple of years , the hypertext community didn &apos;t recognize him either .
like this . and let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again .
voice : and who are these ? mt : ah , mischief-makers . watch .
thank you .
now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of china ?
i &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
india , the united states , indonesia , brazil -- all of them are multiracial .
so you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in china is very different from our experience in western history .
unfortunately , i think , i have to say that i think attitude towards china is that of a kind of little westerner mentality .
i would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
but i want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
so that all past , present and future genres can be studied and abstracted , live .
inside your heart a voice is calling .
thank you .
she said , &quot; don &apos;t say that , &quot; but i &apos;m saying it anyway .
he said , &quot; oh , so am i. &quot;
so , i tried going to the art store .
i said , i &apos;m going to collaborate with anybody and everybody i meet .
i have to travel seven oceans , and i have to come and see you .
150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding .
i was very upset .
i moved back to new york , my work has changed .
i hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride , and touch children and be honest .
there is the achilles &apos; heel of growing inequality --
increasingly , over time , this will be possible from our own skin -- able to replicate parts of the body .
small levels of stock push resilience into other people &apos;s responsibility .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and last is that we &apos;re more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before -- except for if you &apos;re sitting next to someone .
they made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching .
they &apos;re both peer-to-peer car-sharing services , because the two things that really work for car-sharing is , one , the car has to be available , and two , it &apos;s within one or two blocks of where you stand .
i look at things as platforms .
there &apos;s a pop-up general store every three weeks , and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies .
i have a website -- it &apos;s a directory -- and it started with about 1,200 companies , and in the last two-and-a-half months it &apos;s up to about 3,300 companies .
what about art ?
i mean , these kids , without control , throwing molotov cocktails , attacking the cops and the firemen , looting everything they could in the shops .
asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment .
and then there was always a silence .
most of the places i went to , i decided to go there because i &apos;ve heard about it through the media .
after that day , everyone in the favela gave me the green light .
they kept asking me , &quot; what is the purpose of your project ?
when you look at kibera now , they look back .
because that &apos;s a big part of it . there &apos;s layers behind each photo .
they asked me , &quot; please , make our story travel with you . &quot;
or , &quot; how can we help ? &quot;
e : hi , sweetheart .
now , einstein also thinks , you know , working in caves and travelling through space -- it &apos;s all very dangerous jobs .
e : what &apos;s the matter ?
e : happy birthday to you .
sw : at the zoo we have big cats from the jungle .
i would run into the living room , jump up on the couch , rip the cushions off , throw them on the floor , scream at the top of my lungs and run out
and the turnaround in swimming came when a friend of mine said , &quot; i will go a year without any stimulants &quot; -- this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy -- &quot; if you can complete a one kilometer open water race . &quot;
that &apos;s it . that &apos;s really all you need to know .
the other 4,999 students in the school , who were japanese , besides the american .
i looked a lot like an orangutan , our close cousins , or the incredible hulk . not very good for ballroom dancing .
now the protectionism of argentine dance teachers aside , i found this very interesting . so i decided to focus on three of those commonalities .
there are many different types .
it &apos;s an idea for a new kind of school , which turns on its head much of our conventional thinking about what schools are for and how they work .
and the business organizations thought we were onto something in terms of a way of preparing children much better for real-life work today .
i &apos;m going to start with a little story .
there &apos;s more mass in the microbes than the mass of our brain .
and fortunately , in the course of this project , the transplant surgeons and the other people decided , forget common practice . we have to switch .
well , one thing that animals seem to do is , they eat poo -- coprophagia .
it doesn &apos;t mean that it affects every part of us , but it might .
and i &apos;m going to tell you what the cost of wikipedia is , but first i &apos;ll show you how big it is .
so we &apos;re doing around 1.4 billion page views monthly , so it &apos;s really gotten to be a huge thing .
and no side of the political spectrum has a monopoly on either of those qualities .
this is really important , because a lot of new pages that get created are just garbage that have to be deleted , you know , asdfasdf .
so , i mentioned earlier , people type asdfasdf -- it needs to be deleted . cases like that , the administrators just delete it .
so how &apos;s all this governed ?
but they managed to get 18 people to come and vote in a fairly absurd way to delete a perfectly valid article .
and we actually have a project that i &apos;m personally really excited about , which is the wiki books project , which is an effort to create textbooks in all the languages .
and as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon , it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow .
my body is numb with grief .
wild is love .
foremost , i have come to think that romantic love is a drive , a basic mating drive .
in fact , i think animal attraction can be instant -- you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant .
i think we &apos;ve evolved four very broad personality types associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain .
and i &apos;m going to play some songs for you tonight that are , literally , world premieres .
yves rossy : fly with the jetman
ladies and gentlemen , an historic flight has begun .
you are just in the element .
so you have to adapt .
bg : we saw the 2009 crossing of the gibraltar strait where you lost control and then you dived down into the clouds and in the ocean .
we have a hundred years of experience .
yr : and also the currents are quite funny there .
&lt; transcript &gt;
now , what had changed ?
and the unseen , you have to admit , doesn &apos;t come to us through the senses .
it &apos;s like all knowledge . it &apos;s conjectural , guesswork , tested by observation , not derived from it .
that accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth .
but the more important one is explanationless theories .
this is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-saharan africa .
the technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down .
and that &apos;s where i became truly obsessed with this polar realm .
thank you very much . i appreciate it .
here &apos;s a mother and her two year-old cub were traveling on a ship a hundred miles offshore in the middle of nowhere , and they &apos;re riding on this big piece of glacier ice , which is great for them ; they &apos;re safe at this point .
this is after an hour under the ice .
even though that spirit bear moment was powerful , i don &apos;t think i &apos;ll ever have another experience like i did with these leopard seals .
after five days of crossing the drake passage , we have finally arrived at antarctica .
so she did this threat display for a few minutes , and then the most amazing thing happened -- she totally relaxed .
and she would get frustrated ; she &apos;d blow bubbles in my face .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
when i &apos;m joking , i try and explain it happened at midnight , you see , while we were asleep , but it was midnight 15 years ago . okay ?
he wisely explains this to us . he says design thinking must tackle big systems for the challenges we have .
what he did was , he got a transparent pipe — have you seen this demonstration before ? — he attached it to a tap . so effectively what you had was , you had a situation where — i &apos;ll try and draw the tap and the pipe , actually i &apos;ll skip the tap . the taps are hard .
if you work in an institution , one day you will get them to make that decision .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
this is from some guy named ted .
let &apos;s study some moral psychology and see where it takes us .
it &apos;s only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate , join together into groups , but in this case , groups that are united to fight other groups .
on the left , i &apos;ve plotted the scores for liberals ; on the right , those for conservatives ; in the middle , the moderates .
because liberals like to say , &quot; fetch , please . &quot;
i don &apos;t want to be a sucker . i &apos;m not going to cooperate . &quot;
but it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub-groups , and if those sub-groups have some internal structure , and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality , to pursue higher , nobler ends .
you find the same thing in hinduism .
step out of the moral matrix , just try to see it as a struggle playing out , in which everybody does think they &apos;re right , and everybody , at least , has some reasons -- even if you disagree with them -- everybody has some reasons for what they &apos;re doing .
but they aren &apos;t trained in the same way that police officers are and they &apos;re certainly not equipped in the same way police officers are .
you &apos;ve got non-lethal shotgun rounds that contain rubber pellets instead of the traditional metal ones .
so i actually started to investigate some of those issues and have a look at the way that police use non-lethal weapons when they &apos;re introduced and some of the problems that might arise out of those sorts of things when they actually do introduce them .
anyone want to take a stab at the number of times , given how they &apos;ve introduced this , the number of times police in queensland used o.c. spray in that period ?
it was used indiscriminately .
she wasn &apos;t violent .
they &apos;re trained to be more restrained in the use of force than the military are .
it &apos;s a scraper bike ; it &apos;s called -- from oakland .
people are remaking things into fashion .
makers today , to some degree , are out on the edge .
and then he didn &apos;t particularly like school that much , but he got involved in robotics competitions , and he realized he had a talent , and , more importantly , he had a real passion for it .
now that could be a dog door , it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn &apos;t ,
think how much money and how many years it took nasa to get satellites into space .
this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it &apos;s all about sex tips .
but still , glamour is an illusion .
when you stack people in rows , the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground --
and yet you will see in religious art , saints or the virgin mary will often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms .
you don &apos;t think about how nicole kidman is maneuvering that dress -- she just looks completely natural .
it invites us into the world but it doesn &apos;t give us a completely clear picture .
&quot; the matrix &quot; is a movie that is all about glamour .
and here &apos;s hedy lamarr .
that means we all share a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
so here , we have a young female and a male engaged in a chase game .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so i &apos;m going to tell you three things about this today .
and he says , &quot; yum yum yum yum yum !
rs : and ivan says , &quot; i want my cheese sandwich . &quot;
rs : was ivan being mean and naughty for taking joshua &apos;s sandwich ?
and she puts it in her friend &apos;s coffee .
so i &apos;m going to show you a demo of this .
chris anderson : so , i have a question . when you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people &apos;s moral judgments , that sounds alarming .
we knew how brains see , and how they control the body and how they hear and sense .
it was a way of keeping my head attached .
i heard people murmur from time to time that i should love my body , so i learned how to do this .
and many of the women had holes in their bodies -- holes , fistula -- that were the violation of war -- holes in the fabric of their souls .
and in the name of connectedness , the only thing she wanted before she died was to be brought home by her beloved gulf of mexico .
it was underpaid and really loving nurses .
no , we speed them up , don &apos;t we ? so we used to dial ; now we speed dial .
am i really in such a hurry that i &apos;m prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day ? &quot;
and thankfully , the answer is yes , because what i discovered , when i began looking around , that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better , and that busier is best .
so , you know , even sex is on a stopwatch these days .
and even if they sometimes do nothing at all .
or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life .
and we &apos;ll go off and have a conversation on that .
this used to be an island -- ackerman island -- and we filled in the channel during the depression to create jobs . &quot;
there &apos;s an anteroom with photographs of children who perished and then you come into a large space .
and i recommended they do it right there , on that hill and this hill , and bridge all the way into the town .
and at night , just one line of light cuts through the mountain , which is a skylight on top of that triangle .
i &apos;d like to conclude by saying something ... i &apos;d like to conclude by relating all of what i &apos;ve said to the term &quot; beauty . &quot;
because it has provoked , and does provoke , a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a western soul , especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens of turbulence and turmoil .
a rising tide lifts all boats .
i won &apos;t be able to tell you what it is until it happens .
see , these all lie right inside of this general emotional palette that we were painting .
well we &apos;re jazz musicians , so stereotypically we don &apos;t have a great relationship to finance .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and the way it works is , it comes from the southwest .
so it &apos;s essentially a freshwater animal .
something like this , these are all this species globe skimmer .
so , why is it that every year millions of dragonflies , millions , millions of dragonflies turn up ?
so , next thing i did is i got on the phone .
october , november , december . that is not the northeast monsoon season .
and i know because when you look at the rainfall , these particular insects , these globe skimmers breed in temporary rain water pools .
just last week the rains broke . the short rains broke
a quite incredible feat .
they have the most incredible journey , but several make the crossing from india to africa . includes this one , the hobby .
malcolm gladwell : the strange tale of the norden bombsight
it &apos;s a complicated physics problem .
he was simple the instrument of god &apos;s will .
well in a real war , you can &apos;t do that ; you &apos;ll get shot down .
if you go into the military , you &apos;ll find lots of carl nordens as well .
well it &apos;s extraordinary .
why build a virtual world ? philip rosedale talks about the virtual society he founded , second life , and its underpinnings in human creativity . it &apos;s a place so different that anything could happen .
i also think that more generally , the use of the internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend .
we always play a game at the office where you can take any article and find the same article where you just replace the words &quot; second life &quot; with &quot; web , &quot; and &quot; virtual reality &quot; with &quot; internet . &quot;
the web puts information in the form of text and images .
so i think that &apos;s another big point .
we finally gave up , took it out of the code .
jh : questions for philip rosedale ? right here .
65 percent of the users are not in the united states .
pr : if you count , yeah , cities . so -- but i did -- and i didn &apos;t do -- i think i didn &apos;t do as well in school as i could have . i think you &apos;re right .
what is happiness , and how can we all get some ? biochemist turned buddhist monk matthieu ricard says we can train our minds in habits of well-being , to generate a true sense of serenity and fulfillment .
it &apos;s about two meters by three , and you are all welcome any time .
like , you can feel intense pleasure and some others around you can be suffering a lot .
and also , when things go wrong , we try to fix the outside so much , but our control of the outer world is limited , temporary , and often , illusory .
is change possible in our emotions , in our traits , in our moods ?
so then , it &apos;s a self-perpetuating process .
this is the place where the meditators -- you can see it &apos;s kind of inspiring .
some meditators , without trying to stop it , but simply by being completely open , thinking that that bang is just going to be just a small event like a shooting star , they are able not to move at all .
all humans share some common bits of dna , passed down to us from our african ancestors . geneticist spencer wells talks about how his genographic project will use this shared dna to figure out how we are -- in all our diversity -- truly connected .
and the second question is related , but slightly different .
the field of paleoanthropology , i &apos;ll argue , gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry , but it doesn &apos;t give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists .
instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry , digging things up out of the ground , possible ancestors , and saying it on the basis of morphology -- which we still don &apos;t completely understand ,
a haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes --
now , even though these are simplified versions of the real trees , they &apos;re still kind of complicated , so let &apos;s simplify them .
why was it that we seem to have come out of africa so recently ?
we nearly went extinct . we were hanging on by our fingernails .
so those of you who are going on one of the post-conference tours , you &apos;ll get to see what a real savannah is like .
hundreds of thousands of dna samples from people all over the world . &quot;
so how are we doing on the project ? we &apos;ve got about 25,000 samples collected from indigenous people around the world .
eric beinhocker estimates that in new york city alone , there are some 10 billion skus , or distinct commodities , being traded .
the universe is tiny ; it &apos;s smaller than an atom .
and the universe is now significantly more interesting and more complex .
you also need a great diversity of chemical elements , and you need liquid such as water .
so dna &apos;s learning and it &apos;s building greater diversity and greater complexity .
it &apos;s what makes us different .
so what big history can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us , but it can also show us our power with collective learning .
these losses , they feel , emotionally , they feel very different from what we actually thought about it when markets were going up . &quot; so we &apos;re probably not doing a great job when it comes to risk taking .
how do we take an understanding of the money mistakes people make , and then turning the behavioral challenges into behavioral solutions ?
what are we going to do about it ?
let me now talk about another behavioral obstacle to saving having to do with inertia .
therefore , 99 percent of people are organ donors .
whether you think about immediate gratification , and the chocolates versus bananas , it &apos;s just painful to save now .
saving more today is not an option .
we &apos;ve got a lot to do , a lot to solve , also in the retirement area when it comes to what people do with their money after retirement .
we &apos;ve only done two shows in 2007 so far , but our first show was actually the coldest performance we &apos;ve ever had .
this is eleanor roosevelt .
so , i was just asked to go and shoot this film called &quot; elizabeth . &quot;
you know , simple words lost in the quicksand of experience .
so what do you do ?
and he said , &quot; son , it goes on forever . &quot;
we tell our stories , and a person without a story does not exist .
so when i work with rahman who &apos;s a great musician , i often tell him , &quot; don &apos;t follow what the script already says .
of course , when i asked cate blanchett , i said , &quot; what &apos;s the film about ? &quot;
is it his ?
the camera &apos;s looking down at her because she &apos;s in the well .
they started to build flyovers to get from a to b faster , but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth to another area of relative wealth .
all contradictions of his notes suggest the harmony .
gave it more love and care than my own child .
that &apos;s not by chance , that &apos;s by design .
it &apos;s the purest form of cinematic storytelling .
she believed that all well-drawn characters have a spine .
and i finally came across this fantastic quote by a british playwright , william archer : &quot; drama is anticipation mingled with uncertainty . &quot; it &apos;s an incredibly insightful definition .
and we had naively thought , well woody in &quot; toy story &quot; has to become selfless at the end , so you &apos;ve got to start from someplace .
i couldn &apos;t get enough of it .
and that &apos;s what i think the magic ingredient is , the secret sauce , is can you invoke wonder .
it doesn &apos;t always mean plot or fact .
and i got really good at predicting how many body bags you would need for the people who were going to die in these camps .
and the people who made money from brazil nuts were not the people who made money from cutting the forests .
for bankers , we &apos;d be living off the principal , not the interest .
we need to use less to make more .
we need cargill to work with bunge .
if we work with those , if we change those companies and the way they do business , then the rest will happen automatically .
it &apos;s not all fun and games .
why is cargill important ?
that is an externality by definition .
the special relationship between the united states and the u.k. is based not only on the relationship between governments , but the common language and the values that we share ,
and my mother , the most important role model in my life , who lives with us at the white house and helps to care for our two little daughters , malia and sasha .
and i think about that today because i am reminded and convinced that all of you in this school are very important parts of closing that gap .
i thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world .
because the world is big .
so i closed my eyes , i took breath and the first thing that came up and out was &quot; summertime , &quot; porgy and bess .
jonathan zittrain : the web as random acts of kindness
they had none of that .
now , of course , in a mosh pit it &apos;s hard to specify a destination .
then , at moment number two , you have the fake announcement go out .
jimbo &apos;s idea was for nupedia .
not because it &apos;s a job , not because it &apos;s a career , but because it &apos;s a calling .
we see it on blogs all over the place .
in fact , talk about technology imitating life imitating tech , or maybe it &apos;s the other way around . an nyu researcher here took little cardboard robots with smiley faces on them , and a motor that just drove them forward and a flag sticking out the back with a desired destination .
what it &apos;s saying to you is what we heard yesterday , demosthenes was saying to us .
the authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business .
and i walked 10 miles or so , all morning , to get there , to the medicine man .
and if 5,000 dollars every year -- so that &apos;s 50,000 dollars .
so if the telephone is a production tool , then we don &apos;t quite have to worry about the purchasing power .
so what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank .
and of course , it &apos;s very beneficial in a lot of ways .
and this is a new project i have with dean kamen , the famous inventor in america .
and i realized that perhaps the western world will not continue to dominate the world forever .
and 1858 in japan was the year when japan had to sign the harris treaty and accept trade on favorable condition for the u.s .
united kingdom , united states .
but they went up here , and india was trying to follow .
uttar pradesh , the biggest of the states here , is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of india .
and we shall see what will happen with these countries .
i consider really the big obstacle because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity is what will create a domestic market , what will avoid social instability , and which will make use of the entire capacity of the population .
because , as i &apos;ll explain to you , the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected .
so we see the galaxy and fixate on that , but it &apos;s actually a cloud of dark matter that &apos;s dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy .
now , suppose i put in the middle a cluster of galaxies -- and don &apos;t forget the dark matter , ok .
but ignore the top part .
and that is the dark matter in which the cluster is embedded , ok .
the startling answer to this question , ok , from these experiments , was that space is expanding at a faster rate today than it was a few billion years ago , ok .
i mean that we have mathematically consistent theories that were actually introduced to explain a completely different phenomenon , ok , things that i haven &apos;t even talked about , that each predict the existence of a very weakly interacting , new particle .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and that job is that they go around and pick up syringes from the back of hospitals , wash them , and in the course of this , obviously picking them up they injure themselves .
and in comparison , a coca-cola is 10 times the price .
imagine , and if you haven &apos;t done this in a while , do .
it was so architectural . it was so precise .
how does nature repel bacteria ?
and now kinetic and architectural firms like grimshaw are starting to look at this as a way of coating buildings so that they gather water from the fog .
every red blood cell of your body right now has these hourglass-shaped pores called aquaporins .
embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance , always .
mit just has a new radio chip that uses far less power than our chips .
and that information will go into asknature.org .
but this talk is going to be about understanding facts about the epidemic .
every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie , every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies , that &apos;s a costly investment in your health .
but it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before .
in kenya , in zambia , and a bunch of countries , there &apos;s been testing in random samples of the population .
but it does suggest that that number might be a little big .
even though it is the case that poverty is linked to aids , in the sense that africa is poor and they have a lot of aids , it &apos;s not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run , that improving exports and improving development -- to a decline in hiv prevalence .
there are more things that i think that i want to do .
what motivated me to film their behavior was something that i asked my scientific advisers : &quot; what motivates the pollinators ? &quot;
i &apos;m a product of this visionary mother and father .
and the second thing , which has stayed with me , which became my philosophy of life , which made all the difference , is : 100 things happen in your life , good or bad .
so this was how it came into my service , and it was different from the men .
i said , &quot; do you pray ? &quot;
secondly , this concept .
secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in india .
this of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
amazon , now with the kindle , is trying to digitize books .
so every time you buy tickets on ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
then of course , you fill out the captcha because you help us digitize a book .
it started with me posing a question to my graduate student , severin hacker .
this person starts apologizing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
the other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
we &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
now the thing that i &apos;m most excited about with duolingo is i think this provides a fair business model for language education .
now , a decade later , it &apos;s really time to push the envelope a little bit ,
this is all happening with excess capacity .
it took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right .
cool guys , excited guys , and here is selma , who -- i love this driver .
matt killingsworth : want to be happier ? stay in the moment
and it &apos;s not just a lot of people , it &apos;s a really diverse group , people from a wide range of ages , from 18 to late 80s , a wide range of incomes , education levels , people who are married , divorced , widowed , etc .
it &apos;s one of their least enjoyable activities , and yet they are substantially happier when they &apos;re focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else .
my hope is that over time , by tracking people &apos;s moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences in daily life , we &apos;ll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness , and then in the end , a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that &apos;s not only richer and healthier , but happier as well .
so here i was in 2008 wondering where i was in my life .
and i asked one of the voters , i said , &quot; whom are you going to vote for ? &quot;
after all , they decide , and they did .
and yes , we africans can .
so a few months later , in 2008 , one of our scientists built on that research . he took skin biopsies , this time from people who had a disease , als , or as you call it in the u.k. , motor neuron disease .
so we really have to change this .
biochemist kary mullis talks about the basis of modern science : the experiment . sharing tales from the 17th century and from his own backyard-rocketry days , mullis celebrates the curiosity , inspiration and rigor of good science in all its forms .
and the english set up cromwell and a whole bunch of republicans or whatever , and not the kind of republicans we had .
so therefore the church said that you can &apos;t make a vacuum , you know .
and god was out of the picture .
remember , that &apos;s a short time .
and i knew that frogs -- little frogs -- had aspirations of space travel , just like people . and i -- i was looking for a -- a propulsion system that would like , make a rocket , like , maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles .
and then it cooled down to a brick-hard substance , that when you lit that , it went off like a bat .
because the results of it were so spectacular that if it worked it was going to change everybody &apos;s goddamn way of doing molecular biology .
and they weren &apos;t the curious little boys that liked to put frogs up in the air .
but in fact , it was just coming up -- it was the nighttime ; the daytime temperatures didn &apos;t go up .
there isn &apos;t a problem with global warming any longer , so we can -- you know , they &apos;re funding .
so , eventually i decided to pursue an mfa instead of an m.d .
and , in a way , i wanted the human figure in the picture to become a part of that nature .
one thing that struck me , after this incident , was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city .
they were consistently dug as limestone quarries and by the 18th century , the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats , so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries and dug new observation tunnels in order to monitor and map the whole place .
and this is the first theater project i worked on .
and you can sort of scribble it , if you like --
and that &apos;s no different from imperial college in london , by the way , it &apos;s not some sort of anti-american thing going on .
and this is nasa &apos;s view . they &apos;re stunningly similar .
so we &apos;re not empty vessels ; the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood .
so this is a start .
now if we answer those questions in reverse order , the third question -- is matter evolvable ? --
let &apos;s say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well .
but what else is life characterized by ?
so we have some kind of primordial soup .
so what we &apos;re going to try and do is come up with an inorganic lego kit of molecules .
is there some driving force through evolution that allows matter to compete ?
so what will that tell us about the origin of life and the meaning of life ?
&lt; transcript &gt;
what is the origin of the data ?
it was so tragic .
there was resistance for the old malaria drugs , until we got the new drugs .
i give you congo , which was high , ghana -- lower . and kenya -- even lower .
we never had a war ; sweden was in peace all this time .
we have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill .
and we get a lot a new neighbors .
and we have to realize that we are all going to into this , down to here .
all the time we are trying to get value for money .
i struggled to &#91; unclear &#93; day was a huge issue .
can you believe it ?
and therefore , each component had to have a dual functionality .
here is an american citizen and his son having an artificial foot .
&quot; no ... not at all . &quot;
time for development -- it took around 10 years and 700 million dollars .
and he also said , &quot; i would prize every invention of science made for the benefit for all . &quot; so he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people , not just a few people .
and by whom ?
but it was a poor school with rich teachers , honestly .
that was the lesson . that was the inspirational moment .
then you can &apos;t help but make them go &quot; wow &quot; ; you can &apos;t help but turn it into a memorable event -- you can &apos;t help but turn it into an experience .
even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods , there is a company that manufactured the car that delivered you to the edge of the woods ; there &apos;s a company that manufactured the shoes that you have to protect yourself from the ground of the woods .
are you rendering authenticity ?
universal city walk is a real fake -- in fact , we got this very term from ada louise huxtable &apos;s book , &quot; the unreal america . &quot; a wonderful book , where she talks about universal city walk as -- you know , she decries the fake , but she says , at least that &apos;s a real fake , right , because you can see behind the facade , right ?
right , the t &amp; amp ; a network . then it bought miramax , known for its nc-17 fare , and all of a sudden , families everywhere couldn &apos;t really trust what they were getting from disney .
but surround the brewing of that coffee with the ambiance of a starbucks , with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there , and now , because of that authentic experience , you can charge two , three , four , five dollars for a cup of coffee .
and this is one that i did , probably like when i was around seventh grade , and i remember when i was doing this , i was thinking about that little rock there , and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air , and how the characters -- -- would come shooting out of the car , so , on my mind , i was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles .
and that &apos;s a little found object .
because it could run all the time .
it completely changed what i could do .
so i &apos;ll just let this chair come down .
if the fetus continues to grow at this speed for the entire nine months , it would be 1.5 tons at birth .
the complexity of building that within a single system is , again , beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today .
but we are crazy . we do these things .
and if you have a liquid hot mass , it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum .
it &apos;s a heavy element produced in thermonuclear explosions of supernovae .
it &apos;s one of the mysteries we still have , super flares .
coming back to the most important question , &quot; is there anybody out there ? &quot;
now very recently , very recently , i &apos;m talking about last six , seven , eight months , water , methane , carbon dioxide have been detected in the spectrum of a planet outside the solar system .
it will take about five years .
and this is where my story starts .
and when you ask people about connection , the stories they told me were about disconnection .
i wrote a book , i published a theory , but something was not okay -- and what it was is that , if i roughly took the people i interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness -- that &apos;s what this comes down to , a sense of worthiness -- they have a strong sense of love and belonging -- and folks who struggle for it , and folks who are always wondering if they &apos;re good enough .
the other thing that they had in common was this :
she said , &quot; what &apos;s going on ? &quot; and this is a therapist who sees therapists , because we have to go to those , because their b.s. meters are good .
what makes you feel vulnerable ? &quot; and within an hour and a half , i had 150 responses .
just certain .
this is what i have found : to let ourselves be seen , deeply seen , vulnerably seen ; to love with our whole hearts , even though there &apos;s no guarantee -- and that &apos;s really hard , and i can tell you as a parent , that &apos;s excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror , when we &apos;re wondering , &quot; can i love you this much ?
it tracks your movement through space .
last year , apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation , heart rate and body temperature via the earbuds .
we looked at this and we said , &quot; we &apos;re going to do something with this in an incredibly positive way . &quot;
and he could still hold his wife &apos;s hand , but he couldn &apos;t do buttons on his clothes , can &apos;t feed himself .
it &apos;s two years of this disease . all of the symptoms are not there .
and this is my brother &apos;s profile .
so , can i take this data -- rearrange yourself , put the symptoms in the left , the drugs across the top , tell me everything we know about steven and everyone else , and what interacts .
you don &apos;t want to be on the red line , you want to be on the blue line .
can we find out what &apos;s going to happen to you , so that you can maybe change it ? &quot;
and going forward , you actually don &apos;t want to be a lithium patient this time .
first time we ever tried it . we &apos;ll try to get it better later
something always seems to stop us .
one of the materials that can do this is a remarkable material , carbon , that has changed its form in this incredibly beautiful reaction where graphite is blasted by a vapor , and when the vaporized carbon condenses , it condenses back into a different form : chickenwire rolled up .
what if we combined it with this ?
but in a world where energy is freed and transmittable easily and cheaply , we can take any water wherever we are and turn it into whatever we need .
but this is different .
this means you can forget about the equations and just start to understand the system by looking at the interactions , so you can actually forget about the equations and you just start to look at the interactions .
well , as ownership is related to control , as i shall explain later , looking at ownership networks actually can give you answers to questions like , who are the key players ?
and there are different models which allow you to compute the control you get from ownership .
the high degree of interconnectivity of the top players in the core could pose a significant systemic risk to the global economy and we could easily reproduce the tnc network with a few simple rules .
and on the other side were all my sister &apos;s my little ponies ready for a cavalry charge .
the very first thing i want to do is start my talk with a graph .
and very quickly , my brain starts to think that &apos;s the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world .
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world , but by the way your brain processes the world .
what we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
it was just life-changing , you know . and so , in my life , you know , i was in the tofu ; it was a family business .
and the problem when you &apos;re younger -- for all you students out there -- is , your head gets kind of big really easy .
it took a month to make this part .
we thought , ah , this is when it &apos;s going to happen .
and so i never developed the ability to have a staff .
and i began to wonder , is this the goal ?
very simple boxes : you just press one button and some led interaction occurs .
i brought you guys together again .
so , thank you everyone .
and by the way , all of these numbers are significantly higher if you happen to be black , if you happen to be poor , if you happen to exist in an overcrowded school .
you can &apos;t have plastic knives and swords and axes and all that kind of thing in a kindergarten classroom .
it &apos;s not okay to write these kinds of things in classrooms today .
by the time you &apos;re in first grade , you should be able to read paragraphs of text with maybe a picture , maybe not , in a book of maybe 25 to 30 pages .
they &apos;re glorified drill and practice .
they &apos;re nervous about anything that has anything to do with violence because of the zero tolerance policies .
now like with anything that &apos;s really different from the status quo , it didn &apos;t always go so well testing that aircraft .
and that &apos;s the automated wing-folding mechanism .
here &apos;s why .
it &apos;s held every two years in burma .
the point is that education doesn &apos;t actually work by teaching you things . it actually works by giving you the impression that you &apos;ve had a very good education , which gives you an insane sense of unwarranted self-confidence , which then makes you very , very successful in later life .
there is your environmental problem solved , by the way , guys : all convicted child molesters have to drive a porsche cayenne .
but , actually , there is a thing , just as there are veblen goods , where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare -- there are opposite kind of things where actually the value in them depends on them being ubiquitous , classless and minimalistic .
in the world of food we call it cooking .
it &apos;s simply a question of changing the interface by which people make decisions , and the very nature of the decisions changes .
but it &apos;s kind of like flipping a six or a nine . like a six ,
which i think for anybody involved in technology , is perfectly true .
so i started to consider what i should do , and i thought , i wanted to make my performance better , and to show onstage how spectacular the yo-yo could be to change the public &apos;s image of the yo-yo .
indeed , some people say it &apos;s the best idea anybody ever had .
this is what makes it so amazing .
so , he took the greek word &quot; mimeme , &quot; which means that which is imitated .
they &apos;re selfish information , they will get copied , if they can .
why is this useful , or what does it tell us ?
the memes took a gene machine and turned it into a meme machine .
and he included in there the rate of star formation , the rate of planets , but crucially , intelligence .
you know all about big brains .
we are the old machines .
&quot; haiti was not a natural disaster , &quot; says ted fellow peter haas : &quot; it was a disaster of engineering . &quot; as the country rebuilds after january &apos;s deadly quake , are bad old building practices creating another ticking time bomb ? haas &apos;s group , aidg , is helping haiti &apos;s builders learn modern building and engineering practices , to assemble a strong country brick by brick .
we inspected government buildings .
and they redid that building .
now , you must have all taken a band-aid off at some point , and you must have wondered what &apos;s the right approach .
but at the end of this process , what i learned was that the nurses were wrong .
instead , what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit .
now , how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
and then they took the something else , they walked 12 feet to the side , and exchanged it for dollars .
here is what happens .
could it be that with those more distant things , it &apos;s not a token for one second , it &apos;s something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more ?
and just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions .
so i asked natalie , what do i do ?
then — will i keep going ?
nm : uh , sure .
natalie . we , uh ...
and these are my parents .
so chip specifications , apis , project descriptions , software tools , hardware simulators , cpu emulators , stacks of hundreds of slides , lectures -- we laid out everything on the web and invited the world to come over , take whatever they need , and do whatever they want with it .
and with that in mind , i &apos;d like to say a few words about traditional college grading .
but we discovered it by self-exploration .
crisis . death . disaster .
steve pinker has showed us that , in fact , we &apos;re living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .
and i love this : &quot; watson vanquishes human opponents . &quot;
but then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw-away mentality .
and if that pans out , which i have every confidence it will , coca-cola will deploy this globally to 206 countries around the planet .
and rather than having economic shutdown , we &apos;re about to have the biggest economic injection ever .
we have the passion of the diy innovator .
there &apos;s all sorts of organizations that can use these pools of very flexible people , possibly already once they &apos;ve been inducted .
because right now there are so many people who need whatever economic opportunity they can get .
but throughout the economy , there are facilities that could likewise leverage a new generation of markets for the benefit of all of us .
so imagine that policymakers outlined a facility .
so we &apos;re talking about sectors like home hair care , the hire of toys , farm work , hire of clothes even , meals delivered to your door , services for tourists , home care .
it really wasn &apos;t until i was invited to the homes of people that i started to understand the human toll of the epidemic .
ca : that &apos;s an amazing story , thank you .
solar can do it , and we certainly have to develop solar . but we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar the base load energy supply for the world .
these two nuclei , when they &apos;re far apart , are charged .
and with current reactor technology we really don &apos;t have very much uranium .
we &apos;ve got to take that , we &apos;ve got to make that into a fusion reactor . because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the earth .
i &apos;m just saying .
in 1947 , there was no wind tunnel data beyond mach 0.85 .
we must fly again , because amazing , never-been-done-before things require that you fly .
the result , a four-by-four-inch can support a static load of 660 pounds .
now understanding this structure is very important for developing treatments .
so can you .
chris anderson : regina , thank you .
why did we think that this was the time to go biomimicry and copy a hummingbird ?
ca : how do you answer them ?
groups like buildsafe uae have emerged ,
i have a studio in london that has a particular approach to designing buildings .
so we &apos;ve been working with transport for london , and that organization hasn &apos;t actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for 50 years .
it has a child running through a field , or something like that .
so we won the competition to build the u.k. pavilion .
because the dna of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious , rather than looking like nuts .
a key thing was how people would interact .
they &apos;re just chopped at different heights .
you know how newborn babies believe they &apos;re part of everything ; they &apos;re not separate ?
but from about the age of five , i was aware that i didn &apos;t fit .
i can hardly find the words to describe the peace i felt when i was acting .
we &apos;d be right in assuming that the self is an actual living thing .
but i &apos;m not ashamed of my self .
and when i &apos;m on my bike , i feel that i connect with the profound beauty of israel , and i feel that i &apos;m united with this country &apos;s history and biblical law .
so we had a lot of this going on .
so i would say , &quot; alex , i know that it &apos;s terribly difficult .
i used to think that reason and logic and relentless drive were the only ways to make things happen .
this was the first place where we got some water and supplies . &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
now , the cartoon is not such an exaggeration , because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities .
there was indeed reason to be nervous , and there were moments in which i did feel nervous , knowing the history of what has happened to people who &apos;ve taken controversial stands or discovered disquieting findings in the behavioral sciences .
and a more recent one : &quot; the possibility of sustaining high culture in our time is becoming increasing problematical .
let me give just you an example to back up that last statement .
you might think , well , then they &apos;d be even more similar , because not only would they share their genes , but they would also share their environment .
so , normally , i never do any research at all .
albert reaches in his pocket to pull out , you know , this black rubber band but what comes out instead is a knife .
and he says , &quot; like the humane society ? &quot;
i go in , tail comes off .
literally , the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis . it &apos;s what our network does ; it &apos;s what &quot; dirty jobs &quot; is .
look , i don &apos;t know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not , but do you realize you &apos;ve shot in every state ?
i didn &apos;t know what to do with my life , but i was told if you follow your passion , it &apos;s going to work out .
the business of doing the work comes first , the business of getting it done .
we &apos;ve declared war on work , as a society , all of us .
all of that ? that &apos;s what makes it equally as possible as the genius that goes inside of it .
it &apos;s been great talking to you and get back to work , will you ?
now , the reason i begin by saying &quot; no 9 / 11 , no war &quot; is that we have to acknowledge that islam , as interpreted by a very , very small , extremely radical group of people , was a precipitating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- the precipitating cause of the 9 / 11 attacks -- and as a consequence , at one degree of remove , the precipitating cause of the coming war that we &apos;re about to be engaged in .
well , so says george w. bush .
now , during the cold war , that may have been a defensible position for the united states to take .
what does it mean to say that there &apos;s an islamic democracy ?
a personal story , a collective triumph : dyan denapoli tells the story of the world &apos;s largest volunteer animal rescue , which saved more than 40,000 penguins after an oil spill off the coast of south africa . how does a job this big get done ? penguin by penguin by penguin ...
we have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing , but completely inexperienced , volunteers .
so would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins ?
the first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the apollo sea spill six years earlier .
and this is critically important because , one year ago , the african penguin was declared endangered .
we call it propaganda gardening .
and we are certainly not waiting for that check to drop through the letterbox before we start , and most importantly of all , we are not daunted by the sophisticated arguments that say , &quot; these small actions are meaningless in the face of tomorrow &apos;s problems , &quot; because i have seen the power of small actions , and it is awesome .
we &apos;ve created a company . we are designing and building an aquaponics unit in some land that was spare at the back of the high school , like you do , and now we &apos;re going to be growing fish and vegetables in an orchard with bees ,
and although these are really , really small steps , that increasing local economic confidence is starting to play out in a number of ways ,
suddenly , we &apos;re seeing actions on the ground from local government . we &apos;re seeing this mainstreamed .
but then i suffered a series of career catastrophes , one after the other , and finally found myself in television .
you behave in a committed way , and then you begin to understand the truths of religion .
so the traditions also insisted -- and this is an important point , i think -- that you could not and must not confine your compassion to your own group : your own nation , your own co-religionists , your own fellow countrymen . you must have what one of the chinese sages called &quot; jian ai &quot; : concern for everybody . love your enemies . honor the stranger .
it &apos;s a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all .
let &apos;s get back to that . and the idea , too , of jews , christians and muslims -- these traditions now so often at loggerheads -- working together to create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand , at least , of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world .
it &apos;s actually the same person . it &apos;s just one skeleton .
here i was fumbling around in the ladies &apos; underwear department of a department store , almost got escorted from the premises .
so , i have to use a 1980s drum scanner , which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film .
the coloring , so coloring adds another level to the x-rays .
he &apos;s got headphones on , reading the newspaper , got a hat on , glasses , got a bag .
yeah , i &apos;m quite pleased with it .
i &apos;m also working now with x-ray video .
what are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? &quot;
he learns his whys and wherefores , his causes and correlations , his logic , his fallacies .
we know this because they did an experiment . &quot;
now reincarnation , that &apos;s another thing gone -- the afterlife .
it is basically momentum to energy where the four-vector is constant -- that &apos;s what it is .
i stopped observing the house for a moment , and when i started observing again , everything had happened . &quot;
thank you very much . goodbye .
you become a christian , muslim , jew .
i &apos;ve met women and men all over this planet , who through various circumstances -- war , poverty , racism , multiple forms of violence -- have never known security , or have had their illusion of security forever devastated .
the government finally made a decision that &quot; the vagina monologues &quot; could not be performed in uganda .
when she began her mission eight years ago , she was reviled , she was detested , she was completely slandered in her community .
ee : i think that if you think about women , women are the primary resource of the planet . they give birth , we come from them , they are mothers , they are visionaries , they are the future . if you think that the u.n. now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime , we &apos;re talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet , we &apos;re talking about the place where we come from , we &apos;re talking about parenting .
on the other hand , we kids still dream about perfection .
my own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister .
kids need opportunities to lead and succeed .
and so students like myself with nothing to do , we would learn how to program it .
here &apos;s clive sinclair now launching his color computer .
of course the newspapers love to beat on this . but 83 percent of games don &apos;t have any mature content whatsoever , so it &apos;s just not true .
they &apos;re actually bringing their computers so they can play games against each other .
video : i , like many of you , live somewhere between reality and video games .
i know i can .
perhaps there is a single part of our brain that holds all of our gut instincts , the things we know to do before we even think .
i know though , that no matter how amazing video games may become , or how flat the real world may seem to us ,
she &apos;s never going to know a world where the graphics just aren &apos;t stunning and really immersive .
and to prove it , she says , &quot; the exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same , and i &apos;m going to prove it to you . &quot;
but murray gell-mann yesterday talked about emergent properties ;
now let &apos;s go to young children .
and the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first-order discrete differential equation and a second-order discrete differential equation ,
and we can reflect here the way gillian ishijima did .
we can take a movie of what &apos;s going on , but even if we single stepped this movie , it &apos;s tricky to see what &apos;s going on .
but we couldn &apos;t create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life .
the reason for that is really very simple .
and there is no odyssey to our own moon , much less the moons of jupiter .
as an outgrowth of that , as a child of that revolution , is the revolution in biology .
we look the same to a visitor from another planet , maybe , but not to each other because we compete with each other all time .
it &apos;s a total media circus .
the second is , we &apos;re human .
and to lose touch with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health .
so to me , it &apos;s clear that one of the foundations of that future is going to be the reworking of our biology .
and when she was eight , last year , she was doing a report for school or she had some homework about frogs .
that &apos;s exactly how it happens . &quot; so we &apos;re driving home and she &apos;s looking out the window , and she goes , &quot; mom . what if two just people saw each other on the street , like a man and a woman , they just started doing it . would that ever happen ? &quot; and i said , &quot; oh , no . humans are so private .
you know what they say ?
yeah .
they are shaping our very desires .
and since you &apos;re in my kitchen , please meet my wife .
they can disappear and escape bullets .
but they came up with a book , looking back at 13 years of political crisis in ivory coast .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
well , don brownlee , my friend , and i finally got to the point where we got tired of turning on the tv and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night , and tried to write a counter-argument to it , and put out what does it really take for an earth to be habitable , for a planet to be an earth , to have a place where you could probably get not just life , but complexity , which requires a huge amount of evolution , and therefore constancy of conditions .
we are right now in the beautiful oreo of existence -- of at least life on planet earth -- following the first horrible microbial age .
and that &apos;s what happens in an asteroid catastrophe , because that &apos;s what this was , of course . this is the famous k-t .
this is a gorgonopsian , or a gorgon .
there &apos;s no dinosaurs yet ; just this slow , saurian , scaly , nasty , swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes .
in this particular case , the source over and over has been flood basalts .
but the thing about this is that every once in a while we divers can run into trouble , so i &apos;m going to do a little thought experiment here .
here is a way we can get people to critical care .
so , what we &apos;re looking at now : does it leave a signal ?
every year when it comes to the cotton harvest , the government shuts down the schools , puts the kids in buses , buses them to the cotton fields to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton .
the problem is that the active ingredient in there -- as i mentioned earlier -- comes from pigs .
and the simple answer is they can &apos;t . they &apos;re national .
but you lose that contract for a major brand name , that &apos;s the difference between staying in business or going bankrupt .
so what we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re not only enlisting the multinationals , we &apos;re giving them the tools to deliver this public good -- respect for human rights -- and we &apos;re checking .
we have 4,000 companies who are members .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and no matter how many land mines erupt in a minute , be sure your mind lands on the beauty of this funny place called life .
why was the scarecrow invited to ted ?
and it was here , listening to these poets share their stories , that i learned that spoken word poetry didn &apos;t have to be indignant , it could be fun or painful or serious or silly .
and here &apos;s what happens , and here &apos;s what you would discover too if we all started sharing our lists out loud .
and yes , that means catching all of those miseries and hurt , but it also means that when beautiful , amazing things just fall out of the sky , i &apos;m ready to catch them .
and i always thought that my beginning was at the bowery poetry club , but it &apos;s possible that it was much earlier .
it &apos;s what i strive for every time i open my mouth -- that impossible connection .
as someone who has spent his entire career trying to be invisible , standing in front of an audience is a cross between an out-of-body experience and a deer caught in the headlights , so please forgive me for violating one of the ted commandments by relying on words on paper , and i only hope i &apos;m not struck by lightning bolts before i &apos;m done .
that was a tradition i wanted to follow .
the bosnian soldier who guided me told me that all of his friends were there now .
in 1994 , after three months of covering the south african election , i saw the inauguration of nelson mandela , and it was the most uplifting thing i &apos;ve ever seen .
going deeper into the legacy of the eastern european regimes , i worked for several months on a story about the effects of industrial pollution , where there had been no regard for the environment or the health of either workers or the general population .
a malnourished child being measured as part of the supplemental feeding program .
a marketplace was hit by a mortar shell that killed several members of a single family .
so there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does .
and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better .
if the government wants to find out how you voted , they won &apos;t be able to .
i went out to alcatraz , and i lived on the island for several weeks .
more than two -- you &apos;re reading about larry page already , somebody reads very fast .
in that year , there were 34 countries affected with smallpox .
and in 1980 we declared the globe free of smallpox .
in your ted packages there &apos;s a dvd , &quot; infinite vision , &quot; about dr. v and the aravind eye hospital .
then there &apos;ll be secondary outbreaks , and the disease will spread from country to country so fast that you won &apos;t know what hit you .
but in all seriousness -- because this idea is birthed in ted ,
they reported this to who . who took a little while taking action because who will only receive a report from a government , because it &apos;s the united nations .
i call them &quot; the mystic &quot; and &quot; the warrior . &quot;
and it can be sort of crazy-making , housing both the mystic and the warrior in one body .
maybe that person who worships at the mosque , or the church or the synagogue , down the street . or someone from the other side of the abortion conflict . or maybe your brother-in-law who doesn &apos;t believe in global warming . anyone whose lifestyle may frighten you , or whose point of view makes smoke come out of your ears .
neither of us had tried to change the other .
al is a fire hydrant in the city of boston .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
and if you &apos;re one of those people , i would ask that you reconsider , because things are changing .
and the next report we got said , &quot; i walked over to this location , found the trashcan behind the house .
if we want this institution to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
but these apps are like little digital reminders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
paradoxically , when i let go of these objectives , and worked from a place of compassion and purpose , looking for excellence , rather than the results of it , everything arrived on its own , including fulfillment .
he risked his life as he walked up to people whose families he &apos;d murdered .
sometimes , when the war is over and all the film crews have left , the most inspiring stories are the ones that float just beneath the radar .
something wonderful in a country where manual labor is often looked down upon .
we get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it -- which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information -- release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
and that , after a couple of days , made the kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
ja : the impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
ca : so let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
that &apos;s what they see every day .
and we got a report -- a sort of engineering analysis into what happened -- saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
ja : i &apos;m not sure about the incident .
and just a month ago , this was passed by the icelandic parliament unanimously . ca : wow .
now you might wonder how a 13 year-old girl could come up with this idea .
and the soy sauce results were inconclusive because of the large data range , but it seems like soy sauce actually increased the potential carcinogens .
got rejected by all except one .
in fact , it means that if a patient comes in and they &apos;re resistant to this drug , then if we give them a chemical to block this protein , then we can treat them again with the same drug .
they &apos;re everywhere .
and if you &apos;re remodeling your house , take out all the carpeting and put in hardwood flooring . &quot; because these solutions are natural , these solutions are sustainable , and these solutions are long-term investments -- long-term investments that we &apos;re making for our generation and for future generations .
i find weather extremely fascinating .
but it &apos;s also used to assign a temperature range .
&lt; transcript &gt;
around the same time , i was going through an audition -- the first ever open audition by national television in china -- with another thousand college girls .
she showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her microblog , which is the chinese version of twitter .
the illiteracy rate in china among this generation is under one percent .
but then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost .
they &apos;re not rich at all .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and people would come up to me after the conference , after my talk , men and women .
and then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these -- look like jellyfish legs ,
larry lessig , the net ’ s most celebrated lawyer , cites john philip sousa , celestial copyrights and the &quot; ascap cartel &quot; in his argument for reviving our creative culture .
now , that was a pretty good system for most of the history of the regulation of land , until this technology came along , and people began to wonder , were these instruments trespassers
it &apos;s how they understand access to this culture .
because , of course , every technique that you &apos;ve seen here is something that television and film producers the importance is that that technique has been democratized .
so , for example , they can say their work is available freely for non-commercial , this amateur-type of use ,
i &apos;m supposed to scare you , because it &apos;s about fear , right ?
and we &apos;re beginning to find these little things for malaria , for sickle cell , for cancers .
we should have known that this existed because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye .
now , the last of these things died in september 1936 .
because this thing codes ones and zeros , and this thing codes a , t , c , gs , and it sits up there , absorbing energy on a tree , and one fine day it has enough energy to say , execute , and it goes &#91; thump &#93; . right ?
that &apos;s perfectly clear . so , men read that sentence , and they look at that sentence , and they read this .
it won &apos;t do anything for you .
and you can break it out by counties , because it &apos;s specific counties .
here &apos;s how many people it takes to produce a single u.s. patent .
and the really interesting thing is , you and your kids are empowered to build great empires , and you don &apos;t need a lot to do it .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and it &apos;s important to make a distinction , because if the news is anything to go by , 40 percent of americans can &apos;t -- either can &apos;t afford health insurance or have the most inadequate health insurance , and have a president who , despite the protest of millions of his citizens -- even his own congress -- continues to prosecute a senseless war .
basically , it ends up as &quot; god is on a bicycle with his angels . &quot;
the next day , tom opens his lunchbox , there &apos;s rice , so he throws himself off and kills himself , and tom , dick and harry follow .
and when the book came out , i was heralded as africa &apos;s answer to frederick forsyth , which is a dubious honor at best .
and it &apos;s not the look of horror and terror on fraser &apos;s face that stops idris or us ; it &apos;s the look in fraser &apos;s eyes .
sometimes i can stand before the world and say , &quot; my name is chris abani .
weeks ago , you broke me as a woman once shattered me into a song beneath her weight , before you slouched into that grassy hush .
i can &apos;t even get a coffee date at starbucks .
that &apos;s seven percent of revenues .
we lie more to strangers than we lie to coworkers .
it &apos;s starts really , really early .
studies show that people who are overdetermined in their denial will resort to formal rather than informal language .
they cannot be consciously contracted , especially if you overdid the botox .
now that smile is known in the trade as &quot; duping delight . &quot;
and in the presence of contempt , whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn &apos;t always follow -- look the other way , go the other direction , reconsider the deal , say , &quot; no thank you . i &apos;m not coming up for just one more nightcap . thank you . &quot;
what you want to look for here is an incredible discrepancy between horrific events that she describes and her very , very cool demeanor .
our manic tweeting and texting can blind us to the fact that the subtleties of human decency -- character integrity -- that &apos;s still what matters , that &apos;s always what &apos;s going to matter .
this is the name of my company , giving toys .
it does pretty good .
and you can see the massively parallel processing nintendos there .
i did the body and creature -- well , you &apos;ll see .
i try to do a lot of philosophy , a lot of thinking about all of these projects .
so she comes to the rescue .
so now i have to really figure out all kinds of stuff i don &apos;t know how to do .
and there &apos;s my youngest daughter with her furbys .
here &apos;s an example of what we did with the skull .
and you can see we got a guy from -- who &apos;s just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us , down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything .
that &apos;s what the investors think , that it &apos;s just -- -- right , right . so they &apos;re really sweet little guys .
that &apos;s why pleo &apos;s soft and gentle and loving .
so why does this matter ?
they said , &quot; you roll the ball , you hear some pins go down .
in just five years , their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people .
let &apos;s listen to this song that coke created for it , &quot; wavin &apos; flag &quot; by a somali hip hop artist .
well , you work with the community .
in 2009 , we &apos;re down to 1,600 cases .
we have a problem with marketing in the donor community .
if joe jumped in a coral reef , there are many things the alien could see .
and many people think this is really , really beautiful , if this is your baseline .
and they filter the water ; they keep the water clean from microbes and pathogens .
but , little did i know , until i jumped for the first time in a marine reserve .
one point three million eggs per square meter inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant .
so we did a simple analysis , and it doesn &apos;t take rocket science to figure out that , if you take 30 percent every year , your fishery is going to collapse very quickly .
the trivial solution is to create really large protected areas like the chagos archipelago .
and we need to develop a new model of partnership , truly collaborative , where we are looking for complementing , not substituting .
we think this is universal .
with vibrant video clips captured by submarines , david gallo takes us to some of earth &apos;s darkest , most violent , toxic and beautiful habitats , the valleys and volcanic ridges of the oceans &apos; depths , where life is bizarre , resilient and shockingly abundant .
here &apos;s a jelly .
they go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet .
this is an icon of our robot , jason , it &apos;s called .
a mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles -- no sun has ever gotten down here .
on one of the last dive series , we counted 200 species in these areas --
they don &apos;t need the sun at all .
there are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites .
what we &apos;re learning now , it &apos;s almost like a symphony .
for example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
i &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; two and a half men &quot; and calling it a day .
so i want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
none of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
we need more patient problem solvers . thank you .
and they have absolutely amazing education systems .
1994 , rodrigo started something called cdi , which took computers donated by corporations , put them into community centers in favelas and created places like this .
this is a place called the madangiri settlement colony , which is a very developed slum about 25 minutes outside new delhi , where i met these characters who showed me around for the day .
but they find it completely obvious to use computers , websites , make videos , so on and so forth .
imagine an education system that started from questions , not from knowledge to be imparted , or started from a game , not from a lesson , or started from the premise that you have to engage people first before you can possibly teach them .
here , there isn &apos;t really an option .
you know a chinese restaurant when you see it .
there are big picture schools in the u.s. and australia .
it will lay waste to appetite . it will lay waste to social confidence .
age not at all as pathology ; age as potential .
and there isn &apos;t much we can do about that .
perhaps we still suffer from a psychic pain , a wound .
and he wrote this : &quot; everything you have in life can be taken from you except one thing , your freedom to choose how you will respond to the situation .
jonathan drori : the beautiful tricks of flowers
so all the grasses , which means all of the cereal crops , and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen .
this is a plant here that insects in south africa just love ,
so it &apos;s deceiving on two levels --
fabulous thing .
these are little yellow flowers like we all see , little yellow flowers all over the place .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
see again , the diversity .
and then you &apos;re going to see people start to gather in the center of the city to celebrate the night before , which happens right here .
i took the first 10,000 sheep that i collected , and i put them on a website called thesheepmarket.com where you can actually buy collections of 20 sheep .
it &apos;s about your own interpretation and doing something different . &quot;
you may recognize these two guys .
we made a music video for one of my favorite bands , radiohead .
collaborator three : for all of the frames to be drawn by fans , each individual frame , it &apos;s got a very powerful feeling to it .
and this is called &quot; the wilderness downtown . &quot;
why we might be victims of these career crises , as we &apos;re weeping softly into our pillows .
i think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods .
she comes from an odd place .
it &apos;s a beautiful idea . the problem is if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top , get to the top , you &apos;ll also , by implication , and in a far more nasty way , believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there .
there are simply too many random factors :
in other words , they have failed . and they are described as &quot; losers . &quot;
he is not a loser , though he has lost .
my own theory of success -- and i &apos;m somebody who is very interested in success . i really want to be successful .
and make sure that we own them , that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions .
which is the authoritarian , disciplinarian , on the one hand ,
no one &apos;s ever done it without a shark cage .
and there &apos;s dehydration .
and there &apos;s nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this .
and the next thing is paralysis .
and they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board .
i was swimming with this thing on .
but i &apos;m ready .
so among them , i have been a shepherdess , a truck driver , a factory worker , a cleaning lady .
so i did a series of work where it was identical words in french and in english .
so sometimes i view from the inside , like egocentricity and the inner circles .
here is a three-week papercutting marathon at the museum of arts and design in new york city .
it &apos;s called &quot; fashion statement , &quot; and there are quotes about fashion , so you can read it , and also , because the definition of artist book is very generous .
and then the fruit of the world for silicon valley today .
so i brought back the rabbit , the dragonfly , to stay in that street .
but that &apos;s not the hard part . &quot; so here &apos;s a list of problems that come up .
and there &apos;s one solution that &apos;s probably only a few years off .
and so maybe if we lived 200 years , we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to solve some problems .
so i see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability .
and it &apos;s with us today .
is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds , and the breath sounds , because now ,
fluid status , that &apos;s really important if you &apos;re monitoring somebody with heart failure .
a lot of you have gotten that phillips direct life .
so , now i want to move to sleep .
this was really fascinating because this gave that quantitation about all the different phases of sleep .
alzheimer &apos;s disease : there &apos;s five million people affected , and you can check vital signs , activity , balance . asthma : large number , we could detect things like pollen count , air quality , respiratory rate . breast cancer ,
it &apos;s the number one source of commerce , and interestingly it dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies .
we lose 700,000 people a year in the u.s. from sudden cardiac death .
there &apos;s a chef in spain named ferran adria .
but we had a philosophy , which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second .
so we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world .
but now you will ; we put a biography of james watt in .
there &apos;s a mushroom , ketchup -- it goes on and on .
and while i &apos;ve tried to make my images not too graphic , keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood than normal people do ,
these guys confined their surgery to fairly superficial injuries .
surgery didn &apos;t hurt anymore , but it killed you pretty quickly .
some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years ,
now , what you put between those instruments and those hands , is a large , fairly complicated robot .
and the problem is it gets time-consuming , and cumbersome .
we need to be able to guide what we &apos;re cutting in a much better way .
and we can leave the patient whole and intact and functional afterwards .
well , if you teach , if you worship in the temple of learning , do not mock the gods ,
this is not about jobs that suck .
they come into slavery because someone has asked them this question .
so , that &apos;s a scenario that we think we should be capitalizing on .
you buy them cheaply , you use them ,
and it can be done .
and america is still paying the price for the botched emancipation of 1865 .
the legendary design team charles and ray eames made films , houses and classic midcentury modern furniture . eames demetrios , their grandson , shows rarely seen films and archival footage in a lively , loving tribute to their creative process .
in some it is hot .
and charles just checking it out there .
so i &apos;ve always liked this prototype picture .
they didn &apos;t say , &quot; our style is grids . let &apos;s make the chair griddy . &quot;
design was not something other .
audience : party . love . ed : okay , good .
other things could have happened . the japanese could have discovered monterey .
now we &apos;re going to do some movies . &quot; it was always part of how they looked at the world . and that &apos;s what &apos;s really powerful .
and it &apos;s kind of cool for me to be part of a family and a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978 .
and these were steel , mica , plastic , copper and nickel .
and so this is after a day and about half a night smelting this iron .
and for a while that was looking really good .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
an old lady , crying , was carried out of her house and up the road by her son .
voice 2 : it &apos;s coming again ?
there are a few bloggers -- somewhere maybe around 20 , now -- who do , in fact , make some kind of money , and a few who are actually trying to make a full-time living out of it , but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it or they love the attention , or whatever it is .
one of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the internet , and you spend a lot of time thinking about the internet , is that it is very easy to fall in love with the internet .
but we know that occasionally ants go astray , and what happens is that , if army ants are wandering around and they get lost , they start to follow a simple rule -- just do what the ant in front of you does .
when i was a student at mit , we all shared one computer that took up a whole building .
and i was asked , &quot; well aren &apos;t you nervous ?
because if you double one percent seven more times , which is exactly what happened , you get 100 percent . and the project was finished on time .
what used to take up a building now fits in our pockets .
dean kamen previews a new prosthetic arm
i went down to washington . i saw these guys , and said , &quot; i did what you asked me . i looked at what &apos;s out there .
now he &apos;s going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger .
it all began when two scientists , fred grassle and jesse ausubel , met in woods hole , massachusetts where both were guests at the famed oceanographic institute .
and with salting , it became possible to store fish and to transport it long distances .
and the advantage of sound waves is that they actually pass well through water , unlike light .
well what they found was mislabeled fish .
and what we find if we plot up the well-known species is this sort of a distribution .
one of the things that we &apos;re taught in high school is that all animals require oxygen in order to survive .
now this figure is actually based on a brand new paper that &apos;s going to come out in the journal plos biology .
and that &apos;s the deep sea , that &apos;s the environment that we consider to be among the most pristine left on earth .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so we &apos;ve been doing this for a couple of years , and that &apos;s our lab .
one was to tedmed , and one , as you &apos;ve heard , was a regular ted two years ago .
you &apos;ve heard that word several times in the last four days , and everyone &apos;s familiar with kuhnian paradigms .
he must see himself and the world through the eyes of another , and of many others .
and i &apos;ll read you what it is .
now for those who don &apos;t believe this argument , we have trees and grass on our planet without the brain , but the clinching evidence is this animal here -- the humble sea squirt .
when it comes to being dexterous , it &apos;s not even clear what the algorithm is you have to solve to be dexterous .
now by noise , i do not mean sound .
so we &apos;re going to represent a belief with a number between zero and one -- zero meaning i don &apos;t believe it at all , one means i &apos;m absolutely certain .
as we go around , we learn about statistics of the world and lay that down , but we also learn about how noisy our own sensory apparatus is , and then combine those in a real bayesian way .
everything left over is external to me .
because the tickle sensation on the palm comes and goes , you need large numbers of subjects with these stars making them significant .
but critically , they &apos;re briefed about the rules of the game in separate rooms .
you will know what this person is doing , whether happy , sad , old , young -- a huge amount of information .
so you want to avoid big forces as one principle .
i &apos;m really scared . i don &apos;t think we &apos;re going to make it .
i mean , why would you try to refrigerate a whole store ?
about that green tech network i described .
well , two dollars , two dollars is too much for africa .
and who would have thought that all that is not enough ?
because if we do , i can look forward to the conversation i &apos;m going to have with my daughter in 20 years .
and then you start this crazy sorting process that never -- it &apos;s just nuts .
just beautiful --
ta-da .
and yes , the red planet is red .
there are polar caps of north pole and south pole .
so , there is a lot of water below the surface .
that &apos;s because the northern hemisphere is the region of the ancient ocean basin .
and we can search for life on mars .
main engine start , and liftoff .
it took about three hours to get up there --
and this spreads on out endlessly into a distance .
and this holds for germs , ideas , product adoption , behaviors , and the like .
now , who would you rather be if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network ?
the friends of randomly chosen people have higher degree , and are more central than the random people themselves .
it could depend on the nature of the pathogen -- different pathogens , using this technique , you &apos;d get different warning -- or other phenomena that are spreading , or frankly , on the structure of the human network .
so , if we have a population of a thousand people , and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen , we don &apos;t have to immunize every single person .
so , for example , we could use truckers &apos; purchases of fuel .
ben kacyra : ancient wonders captured in 3d
let me show you some of them : chichen itza , rapa nui -- and what you &apos;re seeing here are the cloud of points -- babylon , rosslyn chapel , pompeii , and our latest project , mt . rushmore , our most challenging projects .
this includes , for example , the 3d laser scanning systems , ever more powerful personal computers , 3d graphics , high-definition digital photography , not to mention the internet .
we were very lucky to have two of our partners participate in this : the historic scotland , and the glasgow school of art .
why no hearings , no denunciations , no people getting arrested in front of the rwandan embassy or in front of the white house ? what &apos;s the deal ?
it &apos;s got all the ups and the downs of movements .
why the limits to the movement ?
now , who was sergio ? sergio vieira de mello was his name .
talk about evil prevailing . i mean , here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in cambodia .
so sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness , lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue .
he started , as i mentioned , to get in the room with evil , to not denounce , and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname serbio , for instance , and even when he negotiated with the khmer rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room .
in times of fear , for instance , one of the things sergio used to say is , fear is a bad advisor .
first , i &apos;ll ask you : why should you care ?
and the baby &apos;s cry really penetrated me , as a mother .
and in this slide you see the neurons and the synapses of the brain don &apos;t form .
so i am convinced that if we can unlock the technologies that are commonplace in the richer world to be able to transform foods .
i &apos;d like to talk about what i call our warehouses for hope .
it is a win-win-win situation that starts the food economy moving .
well , the world bank estimates it would take about 10 billion dollars -- 10.3 -- to address malnutrition in those countries .
but when you start to read the article by cliff , who himself is a cancer survivor , who was saved by a clinical trial
this is the state-of-the-art and how we do it .
you then have some body part descriptions :
there &apos;s also a field of proteomics that i &apos;ll talk about in a few minutes , which i think is going to be the next level in terms of understanding and classifying disease .
and i think that &apos;s been the fundamental problem over the last five decades , is that we have strived to understand cancer .
you know , i &apos;ve been using it for two and a half months .
reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug that doesn &apos;t even touch the cancer .
so the diseases we have today , which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades , are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so based on things like this .
ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here , and the drug went to the fda , and the fda said , &quot; without a placebo , how do i know patients actually benefited from the drug ? &quot;
and so , a lot of what has been done with people like danny hillis and others is to try to bring in engineering principles , try to bring the software .
julian treasure : the 4 ways sound affects us
try and listen to the other one . we have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input , which is why noise like this -- -- is extremely damaging for productivity .
i &apos;ll give you two examples . most of you recognize that immediately .
it can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti :
now , even at this stage , we can use the brain model to explore some fundamental questions about how the brain works .
does it have the substance to do it ?
now , of course it takes years to learn how to master a grand piano with a million keys .
now , the circuit , you could also think of as the fabric of the brain .
so , let &apos;s switch it on . but to do it , what you have to do is you have to make this come alive .
ultimately it &apos;s got to be there if we stimulated it with it .
did i say that ? i guess i did .
tim worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment .
and as of just this week , last monday , google earth is now whole .
we &apos;re clogging the ocean , poisoning the planet &apos;s circulatory system , and we &apos;re taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife , all carbon-based units .
natural systems on the land are in big trouble too , but the problems are more obvious , and some actions are being taken to protect trees , watersheds and wildlife .
we need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place .
and one of the things we did at radboud university is we appointed a chief listening officer .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
a month ago today i stood there :
and i said , &quot; you know , there &apos;s no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert , we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to . &quot;
they were our teammates ! they were inspiring us .
this took place in my childhood -- 1957 to &apos; 65 .
it was the first project funded by arpa .
it &apos;s quite dangerous , but i believe it &apos;s better to have dangerous things in the open than think you &apos;re going to keep them secret .
it &apos;s very low frequencies , it &apos;s basically like these subwoofers .
that &apos;s the good news . the bad news is , when i got in contact with these people to try and get some documents from them , they went crazy because i had all this stuff that they don &apos;t have ,
something a bit more free , less constrained . &quot;
our intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable , predictable , consistent way .
so i want to show you some cognitive illusions , or decision-making illusions , in the same way .
so what are they doing ?
so a standard economist , someone who believes in rationality , would say , &quot; you know what ? the cost of lifting the pencil and marking a v is higher than the possible benefit of the decision ,
very good for the physicians .
if you want coffee you have to pay for it yourself . it &apos;s two euros 50 .
the general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don &apos;t know our preferences that well .
in fact in medical terms , that &apos;s our view .
and one of the issues is capacity .
x-rays , useful when you go to hospitals .
yes .
and that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream .
and the answer is yes .
so the data goes in that direction , not there anymore .
and in the future , you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs , you may have 14 billion li-fis deployed worldwide -- for a cleaner , a greener , and even a brighter future .
a genome is really a description for all of the dna that is in a living organism .
well , now you ramp that up to four , and you have a lot of complexity , a lot of ways to describe mechanisms .
that &apos;s a tiny amount of material , but the way that ultimately expresses itself is what makes changes in humans and in all species .
some people will find very scary . i will tell you a couple of things that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me , but that &apos;s okay .
they have discovered pathways that create flavors , although it &apos;s very important to understand that those compounds that it &apos;s cranking out have to match a receptor in our genome , in our tongue , for us to understand and interpret those flavors .
this is not big news to viticulturists ; they have been , you know , concerned with water and fertilization .
now , we can create bad impacts -- we can poison ourselves ; we can poison the earth -- but that &apos;s just a natural outcome of a mistake we made .
and if we don &apos;t make that a reward in training , that will be a distraction .
the poor puppy jumps up , you open the dog book , what does it say ? &quot; hold his front paws , squeeze his front paws , stamp on his hind feet , squirt him in the face with lemon juice , hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper , knee him in the chest , flip him over backwards . &quot; because he grew ?
that will then become a reward for the lower-frequency behavior .
i was working with a very dangerous dog about a year ago . and this was a dog that put both his owners in hospital , plus the brother-in-law , plus the child .
not just with their puppy , but with the rest of the family at class .
this is how we go into a relationship , and it &apos;s hunky-dory for a year .
how on earth about raising children ?
and so we &apos;re proposing a different kind of flexibility , something that we call &quot; compartmentalized flexibility . &quot;
that &apos;s as it was given to us in all of its clarity and glory .
it just so happens to be in the sixth through 10th floor of the building , but that is not necessarily an expensive approach .
you &apos;ll have to tell me if i &apos;m going too fast for you .
it &apos;s almost as though the building could be placed anywhere : wherever you place it , the area underneath it is charged for theatrical performances .
they came to us and they said -- unlike normal developers -- they said , &quot; we want to start out by providing a contemporary art museum in louisville . that &apos;s our main goal . &quot;
now , within that center zone , as i said , we have the ability to mix a series of things .
wk : this is my home . this is where i live .
wk : i use a bicycle frame , and a pulley , and plastic pipe , what then pulls -- ca : do we have a picture of that ? can we have the next slide ?
wk : yeah , if they can help me with materials , yeah .
there seems to be a rule in nature that if you get too close to where you came from , it gets ugly .
you can throw out crazy theories and not have to back it up with data or graphs or research .
the size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population ,
they &apos;ve all been combined together in this technology .
but the difference is that these cultures never expand , never grow , never accumulate , never become combinatorial , and the reason is because there is no sex , as it were , there is no exchange of ideas .
back in 1950 , you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage to acquire that much light .
and they did his silly hairstyles , or whatever .
and the beauty of this system is that it benefits both sides .
and when human beings began moving objects around like this , it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups .
the tasmanians were isolated .
we &apos;re the neurons in this brain .
and in fact , this is one million plastic cups , which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights in the united states every six hours .
more than 400,000 people die in the united states every year from smoking cigarettes .
so , i made this image out of barbie dolls , and so , as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern , and as you get all the way back , you see 32,000 barbie dolls , which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries that are performed in the u.s. each month .
and it will profoundly affect the well-being , the quality of life of the billions of people who are going to inherit the results of our decisions .
now , by the time we get out here to , let &apos;s say , acute bee paralysis virus -- probably a bad one to have if you &apos;re a bee --- this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus , but i can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved among these viruses on the right-hand of the screen are in identical regions right up here .
and , likewise , we infected them with parainfluenza-3 -- that &apos;s a paramyxovirus -- and you see a little barcode here .
well , it &apos;s pretty simple .
maybe they have kids . and then you can see , also , the family member that &apos;s related : rsvb is showing up here .
they did a ct scan .
in fact , it &apos;s not even really sequenced that much .
it &apos;s a classic gamma retrovirus , but it &apos;s totally new ; no one &apos;s ever seen it before .
&lt; transcript &gt;
until volta , nobody could imagine a professor could be of any use .
it &apos;s fitted with solid electrodes and an electrolyte that &apos;s a solution of salt and water .
it could be something like a wind farm .
that &apos;s 200 watt-hours .
to develop liquid metal battery , i hired students and post-docs and mentored them .
from that point on , everything else was pretty much downhill .
so as we eat , the camera starts pulling out , and then we start interacting with kind of larger and larger organisms .
and i &apos;ll also give it a few legs .
eventually they would go out into space , and start colonizing and exploring the universe .
i can also play with the dynamics of this world over time .
let &apos;s fly to another one .
but we also have stars and things as well .
the world wide web ? not so sure .
well , it &apos;s ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains .
now , this is a profound biological effect .
yesterday , negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but -- what &apos;s a virus ?
and , in principle , it could &apos;ve gone on forever ,
they are wiping out languages .
jacqueline novogratz applauds the world &apos;s heightened interest in africa and poverty , but argues persuasively for a new approach .
i had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers .
on a macro level , four billion people on earth make less than four dollars a day .
you can &apos;t talk about poverty today without talking about malaria bed nets , and i again give jeffrey sachs of harvard huge kudos for bringing to the world this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life .
she runs two of the lines , and has already saved enough money to put a down payment on her house .
my job depends upon it .
if you hold it too tightly , you crush it .
south africans just make music really freely .
okay , we &apos;ll play it for you again now , and we &apos;re going to highlight , we &apos;re going to poke out the t , e , d .
the youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy , which as you can imagine , if you don &apos;t have an experience of it yourself , is quite a big thing to take on board .
clarence : i would rather be able to play an instrument again than walk .
well , the subject of difficult negotiation reminds me of one of my favorite stories from the middle east , of a man who left to his three sons 17 camels .
and yet , like many family reunions , it &apos;s not all peace and light .
that system , i call the &quot; third side . &quot;
and what we &apos;re here to do is not to talk about puerto rico or the past .
and so my question is , yes , let &apos;s try and resolve the politics there in the middle east , but let &apos;s also take a look at the story .
what if that could be a vaccine against religious intolerance ?
then we crossed the border into syria , went to aleppo , which , turns out , is named after abraham .
last month , there was a piece in the guardian , in the manchester guardian , about it -- two whole pages .
the path right now is like an acorn ; it &apos;s still in its early phase .
if we &apos;re able to unite our third-side webs of peace , we can even halt the lion of war .
and it starts with incredible kids like this , who come early and stay late .
and that is the youngest nationally certified workforce in america with our bronx borough president .
really scholastic , if you ask me .
the greenest class in new york city .
how does it start ? well , look at jose &apos;s attention to detail .
black field , brown field , toxic waste field , battlefield -- we &apos;re proving in the bronx that you can grow anywhere , on cement .
one got us invited to the white house , one &apos;s a recent incarnation .
i &apos;ve got to say thank you to my wife and family , for my kids , thank you for coming every day , and for my colleagues , believing and supporting me .
a means to determine if there &apos;s a complete blockage of a coronary artery .
and computers don &apos;t go to sleep .
your rhythm becomes irregular , and that &apos;s what happened 45 minutes later .
it &apos;ll pick you up , and then we &apos;re going to call your doctor , tell him about it .
what does that mean ?
and that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on .
that concludes my discussion of epilepsy , which is the third invention that i want to discuss here this afternoon .
engage a company having prior successes for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable tms device that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches .
however , if a video is there that everything was explained to you , and you have it all in the video file , it &apos;ll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency , because it won &apos;t be nearly as good a case .
when i was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little silver pocket watch .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in to this magical device within the device .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book .
and so we build for it in africa first and then we move to the edges .
we think that we can actually create a crowdsourced filter .
there are times when i want to trade all those years that i was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him , and trade all those years for one hug .
in fact , so many different points of resonance that it &apos;s going to be difficult to bring them all up , but i &apos;ll try to do my best .
so , liberating these pages and imagine digitizing them and then storing them in a vast , interconnected , global repository .
ok , what about people who are mixing ? what does &quot; mixing &quot; mean ?
if this book were to be published by a regular publisher , it would cost at least 122 dollars .
and the thing that i realized is there was no way that i , as an engineer , could write this book that would get all of this across .
clicking on that logo takes you to an absolute no-nonsense , human-readable document , a deed , that tells you exactly what you can do with this content .
nicholas negroponte , founder of the mit media laboratory , describes how the one laptop per child project will build and distribute the &quot; $ 100 laptop . &quot;
because some people think that the $ 100 laptop just happened a year ago , or two years ago , or we were struck by lightning --
screw you . go to the back of the line and someone else will do it , and then when you figure out that this works , you can join as well .
well , no , it &apos;s not a laptop project . it &apos;s an education project .
now this people ask all the time what it is .
i &apos;m going to pass it to this handsome gentleman .
we &apos;re purposely not signing anything with anybody until we actually have the working ones .
the answer is , the system certainly has software , but no , we &apos;re not providing the education content .
so let &apos;s look at the concept of traditional anthropology .
they have to go through their primary one , that &apos;s already awkward , and then they go through their second self &apos;s adolescence ,
and so what happens is , when we bring all that into the social space , we end up checking our phones all the time .
why do teenagers seem so much more impulsive , so much less self-aware than grown-ups ? cognitive neuroscientist sarah-jayne blakemore compares the prefrontal cortex in adolescents to that of adults , to show us how typically “ teenage ” behavior is caused by the growing and developing brain .
so i &apos;ll just give you an example from my lab .
the director , standing behind the set of shelves , is going to direct you to move objects around , but remember , he &apos;s not going to ask you to move objects
so there &apos;s a famous quote by shakespeare from &quot; the winter &apos;s tale &quot; where he describes adolescence as follows : &quot; i would there were no age between ten and three-and-twenty , or that youth would sleep out the rest ; for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child , wronging the ancientry , stealing , fighting . &quot;
and you go into the town , and you inquire , &quot; what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
98 percent of babies are born hiv-negative .
a nurse in a busy clinic will see 50 to 100 patients in a day , which leaves her just minutes per patient -- minutes per patient .
and then you &apos;re out on the street , and you don &apos;t know where to go . and you don &apos;t know who you can talk to , because the truth is , hiv is so stigmatizing that if you partner , your family , anyone in your home , you &apos;re likely to be thrown out without any means of support .
so the mothers who work for us , they come from the communities in which they work .
the father and the mother , together , they get the results .
and then this older sister stood up and said , &quot; i too am living with the virus , and i &apos;ve been ashamed . &quot;
the care doesn &apos;t stop when the baby &apos;s born --
and last year , they enrolled 300,000 hiv-positive pregnant women and mothers .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
but at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
you know , as for me , my wife and i have our own crazy legacy project .
you know , we carry so much baggage , from our parents , from our society , from so many people -- fears , insecurities -- and our 200-year plan really lists all our childhood problems that we have to expire .
at doing this . even when i make a painting , i actually imagine i &apos;m behind the painting ,
netra and i don &apos;t write our 200-year plan for someone else to come and execute it in 150 years . imagine receiving a parcel saying , from the past , okay now you &apos;re supposed to spend the rest of your life doing all of this . no .
i discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system .
i decided that i &apos;d rather be an organic farmer instead .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
meanwhile , back at ted university , this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop sun chips .
the scales here are religiosity from zero percent , or atheist , to 100 percent , bible literally true .
and he and his team of junior-high school students were doing real science .
but the thing that i &apos;m really , really excited about is this incredible granola house .
so al , i actually think i &apos;m rather good at branding .
so we build this building on stilts , then up here -- is where we &apos;re going to put the new steinbeck auditorium .
but over the years , 10 years later , the snow packs eroded , and , if you notice , the trees have started turning yellow .
i led three diving expeditions to antarctica .
but tell me where they are and the country that owns them . &quot;
so i thought the scenes of never-ending wilderness would go on forever ,
the islands rise only one to two meters above the surface .
and i was free for dinner , and i went out to dinner with the minister of fisheries in kiribati .
so we had very strong leadership , very good vision and a lot of science , a lot of lawyers involved .
and it was a bottom-up system , and that was very important with this work , from the bottom up to secure this .
so this red line is the employment-to-population ratio , in other words , the percentage of working age people in america who have work .
now , siri is far from perfect , and we can make fun of her flaws , but we should also keep in mind that if technologies like siri and watson improve along a moore &apos;s law trajectory , which they will , in six years , they &apos;re not going to be two times better or four times better , they &apos;ll be 16 times better than they are right now .
there has been one story , one development in human history that bent the curve , bent it just about 90 degrees , and it is a technology story .
the lives of people , the welfares of people , improve dramatically .
i know that it &apos;s incredibly boring to hear about other people &apos;s happinesses .
under &quot; nirvana &quot; they showed this constable painting .
so you &apos;re you &apos;re really bored in the subway , and you kind of stare at something .
and that , as a result , my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me ,
and then we did one more of these .
superman is not only sent to earth from the heavens , or krypton , but he &apos;s sent in a pod , much like moses was on the nile .
and 33 are spread between europe , the middle east and africa .
they &apos;re not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are .
there &apos;s the powerful , the hegemonous , the strong ,
didn &apos;t have a product , but had energy .
but the biggest thing we &apos;ve done to date , which is just amazing , is that we &apos;ve done a 26-episode animated series , which is done for global audiences : in fact , we &apos;re already going to be in the u.s. and turkey , we know .
don &apos;t we deserve to be saved ? don &apos;t i ?
the second one was about a woman complaining because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up and started interrogating her on the spot for talking to a man who wasn &apos;t related to her .
you know , i think that there &apos;s a big parallel between bending the crucifix out of shape and creating swastikas .
500 billion for this pipeline ,
11,900 billion .
and there may well be an upsurge in the concern about their content .
you might want to get some chocolate in .
there &apos;s something almost quite magical about visual information .
so massive , in fact , that it can contain all the other military budgets in the world inside itself .
and if it can do that , maybe it can also change your behavior .
the data is all stored in a google doc ,
often we can get clarity or the answer to a simple question very quickly ,
now what you are smelling is a combination of --
why doesn ’ t it smell of potatoes or violets ? well , there are really two theories .
a theory is something that enables you to do less work .
now , after searching high and low for several months , i discovered that there was a type of molecule called a borane which has exactly the same vibration .
so here you have a system , you have something -- and there ’ s plenty of that stuff in biology -- some substance giving an electron , and the electron tries to jump , and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration does the reaction happen , ok ?
and the problem is it ’ s a carcinogen .
but we ’ re not actually doing it by astrology .
and what about terms like &quot; over the limit &quot; ?
so , how are we going to change the world ?
a few years ago i started developing littlebits .
so for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electronics whatsoever start to play with littlebits as a material .
oliver twist ; cassia in &quot; the concubine of shanghai &quot; by hong ying ; celie in alice walker &apos;s &quot; the color purple . &quot; all of these great fictional characters , all of them who were hurt by their condition , all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films , all of them were fostered , adopted or orphaned .
what happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now . everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by god and by the state for the big society , fast-tracking adoption .
and what -- i should say this here , because this is how they engineered my leaving .
all of the staff were ex-police -- interesting -- and ex-probation officers .
hi . i &apos;m kevin allocca , i &apos;m the trends manager at youtube , and i professionally watch youtube videos .
because tastemakers like jimmy kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
someone made an old timey version . and then it went international .
&lt; transcript &gt;
now we come down to it , relatives grieving . out in the hall with their crocodile tears ;
never succumb to the gorgon &apos;s stare .
what is gone is gone . now sleep .
even when on its worst behavior , i find myself automatically defending the usa from the sneers of green-eyed europhiles playing their greek card to roman trumps .
what of the temples of justice , whose servants enslave us all ?
um , there are --
my friends , human nature is exactly the same as it was when my ancestor -- probably it was my ancestor -- got his hands around the neck of the last neanderthal , and battered the bastard to death .
the love of your son can utterly transform anything he does .
this could be us .
and here &apos;s a very special moment , when my mother and myself were digging up some remains of human ancestors . and it is one of the most special things to ever do with your mother .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re still trying to find answers to , and it is important to realize that there is diversity in all different species , and our ancestors are no exception .
some exciting finds , again , as i mentioned , from dmanisi , in the republic of georgia .
you can see here , again , taken from al gore &apos;s book . but what &apos;s happened is our technology has removed the checks and balances on our population growth .
the frontispiece of this article was this photo , and i &apos;m one of the people that thinks that tina brown was great for bringing photos to the new yorker , because this photo completely rocked my world .
this is someone selling this on ebay ; it was clearly a woman ’ s hand , hopefully a woman &apos;s hand .
first of all , there &apos;s the object in the world .
so , i went down to my shop , and i molded it and i cast it in resin , because in the resin , then , i could absolutely get the glass smooth finished .
and this thing , it &apos;s deeply , deeply satisfying to me .
some 80 to 90 percent of undersea creatures make light -- and we know very little about how or why . bioluminescence expert edith widder explores this glowing , sparkling , luminous world , sharing glorious images and insight into the unseen depths of the ocean .
so , mounted in front of the observation sphere , there &apos;s a a three-foot diameter hoop with a screen stretched across it .
in fact , most of the people studying bioluminescence today are focused on the chemistry , because these chemicals have proved so incredibly valuable for developing antibacterial agents , cancer fighting drugs , testing for the presence of life on mars , detecting pollutants in our waters -- which is how we use it at orca .
it &apos;s got these jewel-like light organs on its belly that it uses for a type of camouflage that obliterates its shadow , so when it &apos;s swimming around and there &apos;s a predator looking up from below , it makes itself disappear .
and there are a lot of different animals that can do this :
it &apos;s this pinwheel of light ,
needless to say , when it &apos;s kluged together like this , there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working .
i promise , you &apos;ll love it .
dna : design , nature , art . these are the three things that condition my world .
it felt like nothing . it has to feel like nothing .
i &apos;m not talking about designing telephones that look like that , and i &apos;m not looking at designing architecture like that .
it went into time magazine in 2001 as the new language of the 21st century .
this is my artwork . this is all my process .
i have a big show with phillips auctioneers .
they laughed everywhere over the world i showed this .
i &apos;m trying to build furniture that fits architecture .
this is my studio . elephant skull from oxford university , 1988 .
it &apos;s true . because there &apos;s a soul in this whole thing .
we are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
it was made of glass , and this building really helped me to do my job good .
i mean , it &apos;s a nice topic for a birthday party or at the coffee machine , but to share this among your peers is something different .
you can pass it around .
it &apos;s been there for three days , and it &apos;s laying on its back .
neil harbisson : i listen to color
and supermarkets , i find this is very shocking , it &apos;s very , very attractive to walk along a supermarket .
it &apos;s not my fault , because —
i think life will be much more exciting when we stop creating applications for mobile phones and we start creating applications for our own body .
she was wholly unconcerned about the bears , but she was terrified of lawyers .
and the total of direct tort cost in this country is about two percent , which is twice as much as in other countries
a culture pervaded with defensiveness ,
we also surveyed that . seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers in america have been threatened by their students with violating their rights , with lawsuits by their students . they are threatening , their students .
well how do you fix it ? we could spend 10,000 lifetimes trying to prune this legal jungle .
but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom .
and here is the hardest and biggest change :
we &apos;ve been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom .
we certainly can &apos;t trust the bankers , and we certainly can &apos;t trust the brokers .
and ken &#91; sharpe &#93; and i certainly know that you need to reign in the bankers .
the way my co-author , ken , and i talk about it , they are kind of like jazz musicians . the rules are like the notes on the page , and that gets you started , but then you dance around the notes on the page , coming up with just the right combination for this particular moment with this particular set of fellow players .
he had never committed a crime before .
she found herself listening to a consultant one day who was trying to help teachers boost the test scores of the kids , so that the school would reach the elite category in percentage of kids passing big tests .
if you reward kids for reading books , they stop caring about what &apos;s in the books and only care about how long they are .
but judge russell did have an alternative .
banking hasn &apos;t always been the way we read about it now in the newspapers .
indeed , we argue , there is no substitute for wisdom .
we began to counter-proliferate , and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of 21,000 .
this was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war , then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover .
so organizations like physicians for social responsibility , around 1979 , started saying this a lot publicly .
how much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb ?
and they &apos;re retaliation-proof .
anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves .
you have , when the blast goes off -- and by the way , if it ever comes up , don &apos;t look at it .
and i just want to leave you with the personal points that i think you might be interested in .
this was sent to me by somebody who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures , but the fact of the matter is that america &apos;s gone through a very hard time .
and he told me , &quot; biosignatures , we need to look for a biosignature . &quot;
if you take the lesson of all these pictures , then you realize , well actually maybe it &apos;s not that easy .
why ? because these things don &apos;t evolve by themselves .
and these kinds of experiments are started with programs that we wrote ourselves .
and i &apos;m telling you , this is very robust across english texts .
now you could ask : well , what about these avidians ? the avidians being the denizens of this computer world where they are perfectly happy replicating and growing in complexity .
now the viability threshold is reached , and the frequency distribution has dramatically changed and , in fact , stabilizes .
and if we remove the mystery of life , then i think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live , and how perhaps we &apos;re not as special as we always think we are .
and that really , really excites me .
he knew , in ireland , that his son would live ,
even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford .
every week , religious extremists take another african village .
these things are under attack around the world .
it is the flowering of the seeds you planted in earlier , headier days .
we &apos;re calling it the one campaign .
and you , at this conference , are in a unique position .
i should add that this started out as a much longer list of wishes .
actually we &apos;re talking to abc today about the oscars .
that is my wish , my third wish .
we utter about six metaphors a minute .
what we see , however , are two overlapping triangles .
if you &apos;re like most people , you will experience a moment of cognitive dissonance when the name of the color is printed in a differently colored ink .
intervene , appeal to the u.n. , or do nothing ?
the mind is a plastic snow dome , the most beautiful , most interesting , and most itself , when , as elvis put it , it &apos;s all shook up .
in ballooning , or in life , how do we change altitude ?
throwing overboard , as ballast , to change our direction . well , these basically are things i believed in such a long time .
and actually this is where the adventure really started .
it takes too much energy . it will cost too much .
and with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane , we can produce the same energy than 200 little lightbulbs .
so , you see that this airplane is more a symbol .
which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life , to get to the success that you wish to have , to get to the point that really belongs to you , with the potential you have , and the one you can really fulfill ?
obviously , there &apos;s always the dark side of it .
and i went back home and i said , &quot; daddy , i don &apos;t know who i am .
so how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you ?
and very , very difficult times .
and it definitely does give a different image of yemen .
no , i &apos;m just joking .
in 2003 , after my studies , it was banned in the european union , but in that same year , the united states epa re-registered the compound .
it &apos;s a compound that &apos;s found in polycarbonate plastic , which is what baby bottles are made out of .
and as a result , when those rats grow up , their pups experience retarded growth and development because they can &apos;t make enough milk to nourish their pups .
we are in effect polluting our children .
the problem is , in my village , oakland , in most of our villages , we don &apos;t see that connection .
she said , &quot; those high notes are going to kill you . &quot;
and it &apos;s not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses .
but his -- well , the only way i can articulate how it felt was that it precipitated my medical decline .
i wanted to live .
during the thirteen-and-a-half-hour surgery , i flatlined twice , 40 quarts of blood were infused into my body .
this past summer , when i was running and singing and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother in the colorado rockies , i couldn &apos;t help but think of that doctor who told me that i couldn &apos;t sing .
half of each year &apos;s 100 billion points of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash .
i offered five cents each for bottle caps .
the throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global .
my first connection with the news media was in 1984 , the bbc had a one-day strike .
any event that happens anywhere in the world , i should be able to know about it pretty much instantaneously , as it happens , for free .
and it &apos;s an amazing way of visualizing the conversation , but what you get is hints at who is more interesting and who is worth investigating .
so if you look in the video , there &apos;s the big umbrella , there &apos;s a white lilo in the pool , there are some unusually rounded edges in the swimming pool , and there &apos;s two trees in the background .
we &apos;re looking for one that crosses east-west .
richard preston on the giant trees
think about this tree , rising upward into redwood space , 325 feet , 32 stories , an individual living organism articulating its forms upward into space over long periods of time .
and i began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them , using the so-called arborist climbing technique , with ropes . you use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree .
these are huckleberry bushes .
i &apos;ve wanted to ask craig venter if it would be possible to insert a synthetic chromosome into a human so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to .
we &apos;re looking at the very top of gaya , which is thought to be the oldest redwood .
exploring with them the forest canopy has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on earth .
it &apos;s true .
so let &apos;s see , here &apos;s a couple of photos i took while i was in pakistan .
you know that you &apos;re infected because it actually shows up .
so you &apos;re sitting on your computer and you &apos;re doing google searches .
i mean , the internet is international .
that code is there underneath the encryption as some sort of a signature .
so what happens when online criminals are caught ?
it &apos;s actually very basic stuff -- thinking about continuity , thinking about backups , thinking about the things that actually matter .
there are lots of thing that the approach i take can predict , and there are some that it can &apos;t .
that person surrounds himself or herself with advisers .
so i &apos;m going to talk to you about how to process it , and i &apos;m going to give you some examples out of iran , and you &apos;re going to be wondering , &quot; why should we listen to this guy ?
that &apos;s the basic stuff an expert needs to know .
these guys are all shrinking , the power is all drifting out here , so the outcome is going to be the weapons-grade fuel . who are the winners and who are the losers in iran ?
ca : so you &apos;re kind of trying to say , &quot; people of iran , this is your destiny , lets go there . &quot;
i don &apos;t know about another category , but we all know how to think .
and the reason is , it &apos;s about appreciation and it &apos;s about contribution . you can only feel so much by yourself .
and what i mean specifically , rather than just some phrase , is if you have emotion , human emotion , something that i experienced from you a day before yesterday at a level that is as profound as i &apos;ve ever experienced , and if you &apos;d communicated with that emotion i believe you would have beat his ass and won .
audience : aye . tr : so the bottom line is , maybe it was where to go to work , and you met the love of your life there .
which , i believe -- it &apos;s not your desires .
third human need , critical : significance . we all need to feel important , special , unique . you can get it by making more money .
because the sixth need is to contribute beyond ourselves .
i &apos;d say one of the parts of the map is like time . some people &apos;s idea of a long time is 100 years . somebody else &apos;s is three seconds , which is what i have .
and the integration that happened is on a film , which i &apos;ll be happy to send you , so you can really see what actually happened instead of my verbalization of it ,
they want to teach me about my destiny .
now science may dismiss this methodology , but polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel .
and i am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them , as potent as the micronesian navigators , that are going dismissed , that this is a testament to brilliant , brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly .
because sony music had registered chris brown &apos;s video in our content id system , within seconds of attempting to upload the video , the copy was detected , giving sony the choice of what to do next .
this is their wedding video .
there &apos;s lots of cases where we have more than one work mashed together .
i &apos;d like to play to you guys , if you &apos;re willing to be the first audience to hear it .
since the dawn of human history , we &apos;ve tried to rectify this imbalance by making art , writing poems , singing songs , scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper , gossiping with friends . this is nothing new .
murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling .
metrics provides more numerical views on the data .
so as you can see , we feel fine uses a technique that i call &quot; passive observation . &quot;
you know , as a child in vermont , on a farm where i grew up , i would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of orion , the hunter .
this is the universe of 2007 , the last two months .
you can see that this is an important story ; there are a lot of things in its orbit . if we open this up , we get different perspectives on this story .
anders ynnerman : visualizing the medical data explosion
and just assume that we will be collecting data during five seconds , and that would correspond to one terabyte of data --
she &apos;s only two years old , and she &apos;s having a blast .
and of course all the data is inside , so i can start rotating , i can look at it from different angles , and i can see that this woman had a problem .
without saying too much about this case , this is a traffic accident , a drunk driver hit a woman .
so we &apos;ve implemented all the gestures you can do on the table , and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface .
and this is also due to these fantastic new scanners , that just in 0.3 seconds , i can scan the whole heart , and i can do that with time resolution .
and probably he is going like this with his right hand , because the left side is activated on the motor cortex .
so this is a lion from the local zoo outside of norrkoping in kolmarden , elsa .
neil turok makes his ted prize wish
i used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible , to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world .
and , admittedly , it &apos;s in a very shorthand notation .
which is , what happens if these two , three-dimensional worlds should actually collide ?
what about those kids i &apos;d left behind ?
but i learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills , especially mathematical skills , in industry , in government , in education .
and so when word came out that aims was opening , it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website .
so here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004 .
he &apos;s about to finish his ph.d. , and he was filmed recently with someone you all know .
we want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers , as it does at aims .
&lt; transcript &gt;
so that &apos;s true love , right there .
whereas this is parallel and it &apos;s fluid .
these are your ones , but you &apos;ve got a few zeros thrown in .
so if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered , it doesn &apos;t show up over here , these two pieces can activate the missing part with these redundant connections .
and it extracts regions with white or light contrast , which will show up on the video as green .
do you put together in your mind the work you &apos;re doing , the future of africa , this conference -- what connections can we make , if any , between them ?
so , to begin with , we need to understand what a black hole is so we can understand the proof of a black hole .
so , now we know what a schwarzschild radius is .
i like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world , because they are kind of show offs .
so , we can see far more detail in our galaxy than anyplace else .
in other words , just a picture that shows the stars -- and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy , where we think the black hole is .
but with this experiment , we &apos;ve confined that same mass to a much smaller volume that &apos;s 10,000 times smaller .
it pulls much stronger on one side than the other and the cloud is stripped apart .
and this means that these things do exist in our universe , and we have to contend with this , we have to explain how you can get these objects in our physical world .
the real key observation he made is that a free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine .
if you &apos;d loan me your gulfstream , i &apos;ll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt .
it &apos;s a phenomenon that i think any organization or individual can tap into .
well , i think it &apos;s the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call &quot; crowd-accelerated innovation . &quot;
but the desire element is really dialed way up .
we are learning from them .
here , let me introduce you to sam haber .
well , so , there &apos;s some showing as well as telling .
now , ted is just a small part of this .
here &apos;s a group of kids in a village in pakistan near where i grew up .
guys , we &apos;ve learned from you today .
well , because mr. anderson told me that this session is called &quot; sync and flow , &quot; i was wondering , &quot; what do i know that these geniuses don &apos;t ? &quot;
you feel like you &apos;re on top of your game and you can do anything you want .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
now , while ... while you &apos;re pushing the clock , there &apos;s a few rules to obey .
you only have to make one decision , and that is : are you going to use the white version for very good tedtalks , about creativity , human genius ?
but if you think a whole lot of other things matter that lead up to well being -- things like your family relationships , friendship , community , values -- then , actually , this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics .
suddenly , all sorts of transport , travel information were possible , and this gave birth to , what i like to call , the bureaucratic age .
anyone thinking , &quot; i could do that service better , i could deliver it cheaper , &quot; it &apos;s all available there .
well , we &apos;ve had government information campaigns over the years when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home .
we have personal computing , why not personal biotech ? that ’ s the question biologist ellen jorgensen and her colleagues asked themselves before opening genspace , a nonprofit diybio lab in brooklyn devoted to citizen science , where amateurs can go and tinker with biotechnology . far from being a sinister frankenstein &apos;s lab , genspace offers a long list of fun , creative and practical uses for diybio .
more regulations , less resources .
now , we follow state and local regulations . we dispose of our waste properly , we follow safety procedures , we don &apos;t work with pathogens .
you can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere , collect microbes , see what &apos;s up there .
and for hundreds , even thousands of years , the home was really the center of life .
you have — cities are where most of the wealth is created , and particularly in the developing world , it &apos;s where women find opportunities . that &apos;s
we think of it as a compact urban cell .
this was a video that was on european television last week showing the spanish minister of industry driving this little vehicle , and when it &apos;s folded , it can spin .
you have a conventional one-bedroom arrangement when you need it . maybe that &apos;s most of the time .
we think these little wireless sensors are more effective .
some say bigger .
and then they &apos;d tow the sharks back to purteen harbor , boil them up , use the oil .
and this represents their habit of basking on the surface when the sun is out .
half the challenge is to get access , is to be in the right place at the right time .
one thing that i think is a very surprising and strange thing is just how low the genetic diversity of sharks are .
i don &apos;t understand this . i don &apos;t pretend to understand this .
this is a shark that was actually landed in howth just before christmas , illegally , because you &apos;re not allowed to do that under e.u. law , and was actually sold for eight euros a kilo as shark steak .
it was only because we had a conference on the isle of man .
and what you &apos;re trying to look at is the males have claspers , which kind of dangle out behind the back of the shark .
interestingly , i asked this question when i was a little kid .
to intentionally harm people psychologically , to hurt people physically , to destroy people mortally , or ideas , and to commit crimes against humanity .
so they &apos;re going to put pressure on these soldiers , military police , to cross the line , give them permission to break the will of the enemy , to prepare them for interrogation , to soften them up , to take the gloves off . those are the euphemisms , and this is how it was interpreted .
so if you want to change a person , you &apos;ve got to change the situation .
the learner &apos;s a genial , middle-aged guy .
milgram did more than 16 studies . and look at this . in study 16 , where you see somebody like you go all the way , 90 percent go all the way . in study five , if you see people rebel , 90 percent rebel .
student : a police car pulls up in front , and a cop comes to the front door , and knocks , and says he &apos;s looking for me .
so this anthropologist , john watson , found 23 cultures that had two bits of data .
and he goes on to say , &quot; the landmark stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations . &quot;
and our kids &apos; heroes are also role models for them , because they have supernatural talents .
and i want to end with the story that some of you know , about wesley autrey , new york subway hero .
antonio damasio : the quest to understand consciousness
the colors are codes for the direction , from whether it is back to front or vice versa .
this , of course , is a visual map that i &apos;m showing you , but this applies to any kind of map -- auditory , for example , in relation to sound frequencies , or to the maps that we construct with our skin in relation to an object that we palpate .
so it provides certain areas for perception and image-making . and those are exactly the same that are going to be used for image-making when we recall information .
so here &apos;s how it looks . look at the region there .
they &apos;re there because there &apos;s this very close interaction .
why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex and how this is made ?
and i &apos;ve decided , for me , it &apos;s been a real journey and paradox .
but it looks very different .
which brings me to the second paradox : sobering up about our smallness and maintaining faith in our greatness all at once .
i wrote about emily apt who initially became a caseworker in the welfare system because she decided that was the most noble thing she could do , but quickly learned , not only did she not like it , but she wasn &apos;t really good at it .
it &apos;s about embracing the paradox .
today we &apos;re often too busy tending to our iphones and ipods to really stop and get to know ourselves .
these brainwaves are being analyzed and we can see them as a graph .
we were making things activate , light up and work just by thinking .
so the goal of the original game zen bound is to wrap a rope around a wooden form .
so you can imagine kids playing video games with their brain waves and improving their add symptoms as they do it .
two millennia ago , those greeks had some powerful insights .
not that we could have afforded i drive , but to give me the dream of driving .
the really strange part is that , at three and a half , just before i was going to school , my parents made a bizarre , unusual and incredibly brave decision .
and then i went in and i got a global consulting job with accenture . and they didn &apos;t even know .
have you ever tried to see that if you have vaseline in front of your eyes ?
and my chest ached .
do something different . what do you want to be ?
but you know , i was believing in the wrong thing .
and so here i am .
you can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck .
you know , in these places in other cultures , people just go there voluntarily because they like them . we don &apos;t have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here . you know , you don &apos;t have to have a kwanzaa festival . people just go because it &apos;s pleasurable to be there .
the message is : we don &apos;t give a fuck ! we don &apos;t give a fuck .
the street trees have really four jobs to do and that &apos;s it :
please respect us , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal , we &apos;re normal .
and we should have started two days before yesterday .
and america &apos;s not prepared .
we &apos;re not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .
video : three , two , one , go !
and so as we move out , we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies , as we see here , light-travel time , giving you a sense of how far away we are .
we &apos;re actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-saharan planetarium in ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in columbia and a high school in cambodia .
and i &apos;d add to that , that it &apos;s not just making it , but everybody , each of us , everybody in the world has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way , and that &apos;s one of the main parts of my work .
if you haven &apos;t seen it , it &apos;s worth reading . he &apos;s a pianist himself , and he details his whole career of looking at and observing incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples &apos; lives in unusual situations .
and it &apos;s about a man , rich , successful , powerful , who wants to live forever .
and i &apos;d like now to invite two very special people on the stage , so that i can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like .
what types of things does he find important to control and convey in a piece of music ?
so , in hearing this piece , as i mentioned before , the most important thing is the music &apos;s great , and it &apos;ll show you who dan is .
but there were problems .
there was this hero , odysseus , who &apos;s heading back home after the trojan war .
because there &apos;s two heads inside one person when you think about it .
now i &apos;m a big fan of commitment devices actually .
the more you exercise it , the stronger it gets .
but aren &apos;t there things that we believe and don &apos;t believe at the same time ?
some of them look like places i lived in as a graduate student .
and slowly , slowly we &apos;re bringing it up to a moderate savings rate .
i want you to imagine this for a moment . two men , rahul and rajiv , living in the same neighborhood , from the same educational background , similar occupation , and they both turn up at their local accident emergency complaining of acute chest pain .
it &apos;s this injustice that has really driven my mission to try to do a little bit to transform the lives of people affected by mental illness , and a particularly critical action that i focused on is to bridge the gulf between the knowledge we have that can transform lives , the knowledge of effective treatments , and how we actually use that knowledge in the everyday world .
it seems to me that there are five key lessons that i &apos;ve shown on this slide that are critically important for effective task shifting .
i began my life as a markets professional and continued to take an interest , but most of my recent effort has been looking at the value of what comes to human beings from nature , and which doesn &apos;t get priced by the markets .
and the answer is zilch , exactly zero .
because these are important benefits for the poor .
and if you see the benefits of the mangrove in terms of the storm protection and cyclone protection that you get and in terms of the fisheries , the fish nurseries , that provide fish for the poor , that answer is more like $ 11,000 .
and the world bank has acknowledged this and they &apos;ve started a project called waves -- wealth accounting and valuation of ecosystem services .
the other favorite , if you like , solution for me is the creation of green carbon markets .
so that &apos;s almost an eighth of society .
he was a philosopher ;
they took him for lunch to a sandwich place in pasadena .
can you build a machine that thinks like a human being , that is conscious ?
and he was curious .
but he was very excited that he had finally met somebody who had the same experience with my father as he had with his father .
he would try to visualize it , guided by a small number of simple principles .
they &apos;re difficult integrals .
thank you .
compounding that , the material of choice , laminate , that i was trying to highlight , only bends in two dimensions .
i thought , &quot; finally , oh yeah great , big company , i &apos;m gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding . &quot;
so where does this trend stop ?
these are inuit children cutting whale blubber .
it &apos;s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on itunes , write it to a cd , then rip the cd to an mp3 and play it on your very same computer .
so with that , let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we &apos;re trying to explain .
there &apos;s not enough young , healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us .
well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
from a meteorite from space , we ’ re over here with an original sputnik .
and so all of western europe started buying printing presses in 1455 -- to print out thousands , and then hundreds of thousands , and then ultimately millions of single , small pieces of paper that got you out of middle hell and into heaven .
how do we create ?
we think about the internet ;
i &apos;m going to play it for you in a couple minutes , but i want to make an analogy before i do to this .
because i have some limited time , i &apos;ll cut it off for a second , and tell you about how it works and what it &apos;s good for .
and hopefully they &apos;ll be sensitive that they don &apos;t want to offend you with just one more outlet .
linearity means higher quality sound .
and so , another way of hopefully determining who &apos;s friendly and who isn &apos;t .
i usually figure out what my talk is when i get up in front of a group .
i became bizarrely popular .
so here &apos;s the word puzzle again .
okay , well , it &apos;s what i can do with some household tinfoil .
it didn &apos;t exactly work out that way .
i don &apos;t have that much else to say , but they turned out really well .
and i actually really feel that it &apos;s worthwhile to spend my valuable and limited time on this earth in this way .
let &apos;s play a little .
inspired by an abalone shell , angela belcher programs viruses to make elegant nanoscale structures that humans can use . selecting for high-performing genes through directed evolution , she &apos;s produced viruses that can construct powerful new batteries , clean hydrogen fuels and record-breaking solar cells . at tedxcaltech , she shows us how it &apos;s done .
so when we think about future technologies , we actually think of using bacteria and virus , simple organisms .
here &apos;s the dna sequence , here &apos;s the protein sequence in order to do it . &quot; and so an interesting idea is , what if you could take any material that you wanted , or any element on the periodic table , and find its corresponding dna sequence , then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure , but not build an abalone shell -- build something that , through nature , it has never had the opportunity to work with yet .
and so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical , but they differ from each other based on their tips , on one sequence that codes for one protein .
and then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels .
and so these companies , they build offices .
it &apos;s like the front door of the office is like a cuisinart , and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits , because you have 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there , and then something else happens and you &apos;re pulled off your work , and you &apos;ve got to do something else , then you have 20 minutes , then it &apos;s lunch .
now , there are different kinds of distractions , but there aren &apos;t the really bad kinds of distractions that i &apos;ll talk about in just a minute .
and if you talk to certain managers , they &apos;ll tell you that they don &apos;t want their employees to work at home because of these distractions .
those are the real problems in the modern office today .
meetings are places to go to talk about things you &apos;re supposed to be doing later .
so just the afternoon , one thursday .
today &apos;s friday -- so monday , usually people have meetings on monday .
and that &apos;s , kind of , where i see what my job is and what our team &apos;s job is .
so , keys provide an access to shelter and warmth -- transport as well , in the u.s. increasingly .
and you turn around , and you look back into the space , and some people talk aloud .
and the fact is that millions of people do it .
there &apos;s a second thing i like about this .
i &apos;m not going to answer that , ok .
if you want a big idea , you need to embrace everyone on the planet , that &apos;s the first thing .
&quot; the stretch . &quot; ok , the gentleman on the left is saying , &quot; screw you , i &apos;m going to check my device . &quot; but the guy , here , on the right ,
one way to change our genes is to make new ones , as craig venter has so elegantly shown .
how sexy is that ?
and then i went home that night , and i had an even larger emotional meltdown , which i &apos;ll say more about in a minute .
and second of all , it requires imagination .
the remaining regrets pertain to these things : finance , family issues unrelated to romance or parenting , health , friends , spirituality and community .
we can &apos;t identify with that part .
now there is a case to be made that control freaks and perfectionists should not get tattoos , and i &apos;m going to return to that point in a few minutes .
i don &apos;t think that &apos;s the case though .
it reminds me constantly of something else instead .
even in wealthy countries it is common now to see inequality growing .
i wanted to focus on activities that would help to alleviate poverty , fight disease , combat climate change , bridge the religious , racial and other divides that torment the world , but to do it in a way that would either use whatever particular skills we could put together in our group to change the way some public good function was performed so that it would sweep across the world more .
we just reorganized the markets .
you think about whatever your life has been , however many obstacles you have faced in your life , at critical junctures you always knew there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted and the result you achieved .
so she now works full-time on this for very little pay .
we &apos;re now working with partners in health and the ministry of health in rwanda and our foundation folks to scale this system up .
i grew up in a very small village in canada , and i &apos;m an undiagnosed dyslexic . i had a really hard time in school .
and for me it &apos;s just the idea that , if this little girl graduates as a whole person , chances are she &apos;ll demand a whole world -- a whole world -- to live on .
there isn &apos;t enough water .
no petrochemicals in the pavement .
and it &apos;s a kind of microcosm of the globalized world .
but what &apos;s happening , our learning-different kids -- dyslexic -- we &apos;ve renamed them prolexic -- are doing well in these beautiful , beautiful classrooms .
the heart of school has seven kilometers of bamboo in it .
i used to be able to talk like that .
and before i left the hospital , after a year of being hospitalized , i had seven ruptures of my carotid artery .
i felt , and i still feel , a lot of distance from the human mainstream .
it still needs improvement , but at least it sounds like me and not like hal 9000 .
for almost all of its millions and billions of years , there was no life on earth at all .
does anybody remember that ? &quot;
ironic that my legs are fine , and it &apos;s my shoulders that slow up my walk .
i am writing as well as ever .
and i was very young then . i think i was 11 years , and i started asking questions , and that ’ s when my political education started .
because in the long run , i think there is no reason , no practical reason for newspapers to survive .
in poland , our pages were named &quot; covers of the year &quot; three times in a row .
then we adjust the content accordingly .
so bear with me as i take you through this journey .
i was 64 lbs .
i was bald .
but the men had a better idea .
they removed a hematoma from behind my eye .
but a few years earlier , while still at school , he &apos;d actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time .
he wrote , &quot; the universe cannot be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written .
recently i took my family --
i can take all of these tiles , and fix them at the yellow place , rotate them by 90 degrees , put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there .
i can reflect it in the line through x , or the line through y , or the line through z .
it still ends up at half a turn .
here are two very different walls , very different geometric pictures .
and the power of galois &apos; mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects in the unseen world , beyond the two-dimensional , three-dimensional , all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space .
60 digits or more , you &apos;ve got to sit down . you &apos;ve overestimated .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and the translations of the surviving texts say , &quot; this i will not treat . this i cannot treat . &quot;
now there is something else , though , in the early 20th century that made things even more complicated .
they commissioned a group of their best scientists to investigate , and what they found was that all these tape drives were located near ventilation ducts . what happened was the bactericide was formulated with minute traces of tin .
if we think , for example , of louis pasteur , who in the 1860s was asked to study the diseases of silk worms for the silk industry , and his discoveries were really the beginning of the germ theory of disease .
and so one kind of information space that i take inspiration from is my real desk .
and i can pull them off when i want to work with them .
and similar topography .
so you &apos;ve effectively negated 60 years of aeronautic research .
and that &apos;s the thing , is that we &apos;re writing things , we &apos;re writing these things that we can no longer read .
but the difficulty of the problem and the fact that we don &apos;t really quite have it down , it doesn &apos;t take away from the effects pragmatic chaos has . pragmatic chaos , like all netflix algorithms , determines , in the end , 60 percent of what movies end up being rented .
it &apos;s because the elevator is missing some important instrumentation , like the buttons .
unfortunately , we have our work cut out for us .
and warren buffet had recommended i do that -- being honest about what was going well , what wasn &apos;t , and making it kind of an annual thing .
actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths .
so the mosquitoes that bite late at night can &apos;t get at them . and when you use indoor spraying with ddt
i can say that , even though i &apos;m a college drop-out . i had great teachers .
now , our foundation , for the last nine years , has invested in this .
you might say , &quot; do the good teachers stay and the bad teacher &apos;s leave ? &quot; the answer is , on average , the slightly better teachers leave the system .
for example , new york passed a law that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used in the tenure decision for the teachers .
you know , the system doesn &apos;t naturally make it happen .
they &apos;re expensive to install , but they are more expensive not to . so , we should look at that .
so , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .
each one was pinched or carved out of a ball of clay , and it was the imperfections that people cherished .
you can see the sort of break in the everyday .
he makes us the subject of his art .
i mean , there were afternoons i was down there , and the light goes pink and there &apos;s a mist in the air and you &apos;re standing in the rubble , and i found myself recognizing both the inherent beauty of nature and the fact that nature , as time , is erasing this wound .
in fact , medicine today is a team sport .
we heard over the last couple days what an urgent problem cancer still is in our society , what a pressing need it is for us to not have one person die every minute .
i mean , in many ways , the way that we &apos;re doing it , we &apos;re still operating in the dark .
and the cool thing about fluorescence is that it &apos;s not only bright , it actually can shine through tissue .
you see a lot of little , roundish bumps there .
what &apos;s the problem ?
i think that it &apos;ll change the way that we do surgery .
ed boyden : a light switch for neurons
ideally , we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies .
well there are many molecules that exist in nature , which are able to convert light into electricity .
so this is very powerful .
now we &apos;ve shown that a brief activation of these is enough , indeed , to drive learning .
okay , there it goes . right now .
most of us don &apos;t have fungi or algae in our brains , so what is our brain going to do if we put that in ?
so he &apos;s not using vision to do it .
and by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero .
and we looked at three different types of rooms .
and given the extraordinary amount of nosocomial infections , or hospital-acquired infections , this is a clue that it &apos;s a good time to reconsider our current practices .
and so even though there were no cars still in the west village where we lived , my wife sent me out to buy a , you know , a large air filter at the bed bath and beyond , which was located about 20 blocks away , north .
well , there are some kind of executive decisions , but mostly the answer is -- everybody and nobody .
because effectively , what &apos;s happening here , what &apos;s creating this page , obviously -- and we all know this , but it &apos;s worth just thinking about it -- is not some person deciding that i am the number one answer for steven johnson , but rather somehow the entire web of people putting up pages and deciding to link to my page or not link to it , and google just sitting there and running the numbers .
google does the google zeitgeist , which looks at search requests to test what &apos;s going on , what people are interested in , and they publish it with lots of fun graphs .
and right behind him is l. ron hubbard . so -- you can see we &apos;re in the ascot , which is always good .
now this is a very interesting thing .
&lt; transcript &gt;
but i don &apos;t know that that &apos;s the common debate .
and at what point did that uniform turn from white to black ?
and the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been farming the same piece of ground for 40 centuries .
that &apos;s the name of the first chapter -- &quot; this book is not a tree . &quot;
so therefore , we have these two metabolisms , and i worked with a german chemist , michael braungart , and we &apos;ve identified the two fundamental metabolisms .
and this is our project for ford motor company . it &apos;s the revitalization of the river rouge in dearborn .
so the way we approached this is we studied the hydrology very carefully .
allan jones : a map of the brain
and that &apos;s shown here in the the very light blue .
they &apos;re controlling who nervous system cells partner up with .
so the first thing that we do at the site of collection is we collect what &apos;s called an mr .
this will then go onto a robot that &apos;s going to apply one of those stains to it .
and it contributes to about 70 samples of those thousand samples .
proteins are targets for drugs .
but the fact is our genomes are greater than 99 percent similar .
i &apos;ll just close by saying that the tools are there , and this is truly an unexplored , undiscovered continent .
and worst of all , we will never know .
and yet it doesn &apos;t happen .
i cannot answer the big question , whether aid did any good or not . but these three questions , i can answer them .
and maybe when you get there , what you find is this :
now , you might say , &quot; well , but it &apos;s not sustainable .
if they get it for free , they use it .
well , with experiments , what you can do is answer a simple question .
two billion dollars got pledged just last month ,
and yet , when the young global leader in davos showed the numbers i gave you , they started deworm the world .
looking at fossils dating back several millions of years -- it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here .
but i really formalized this focus on turnarounds when i was completing my mba in the united states .
so africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers .
so let &apos;s start on that .
but not the south africa we always talk about -- the gold , the minerals , the first world infrastructure -- a bit about the other side of it .
looking at the oil industry , africa provides 18 percent of the u.s. &apos; s oil supply , with the middle east just 16 percent .
again , opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price .
let &apos;s look at some 2006 numbers . kenya : over 60 percent . nigeria : over 40 percent .
because things can be turned around rather quickly .
yours is the other way around , so swap it around .
kt : no .
kb : where are we ? where are we ?
a lot of people try to come up with a logical solution to what just happened , all right .
can you stand over here ? this will just make it a little bit easier .
extend your left arm , ok .
and as you sink and drift and float into this relaxed state of mind , i &apos;m going to take your left hand , and just place it up here .
ok , it worked that time , excellent .
now , have a look at the coke bottle .
i also want you to think of his name . look at me and think of his name .
kb : ok , steve , i want you to take a seat , right behind here . excellent .
no , stay around , ok .
sj : you &apos;re over a cup .
do you think the spike is under your left hand , or under your right hand ?
it was all due to this woman , sister mary marastela , also known as my mom .
in other words , i thought i could design an experiment to see if oxytocin made people moral .
then we match them in pairs by computer .
but the second is that i still only had this indirect relationship between oxytocin and trustworthiness .
a then unknown philosopher named adam smith wrote a book in 1759 called &quot; the theory of moral sentiments . &quot;
and a man says very excitedly , &quot; i was in your gas station a while ago , and i bought this jewelry for my wife , and i can &apos;t find it . &quot; i said , &quot; pearl necklace ? &quot; &quot; yeah . &quot;
these are not people you want to have a beer with .
and i drove up in my rented vauxhall .
i mean , astounding ; no one has this .
eight hugs a day -- you &apos;ll be happier and the world will be a better place .
the empire is gone , so what are we doing with that design that produces these identical people , and what are we going to do next if we ever are going to do anything else with it ?
at the same time , we also had lots of parents , rich people , who had computers , and who used to tell me , &quot; you know , my son , i think he &apos;s gifted , because he does wonderful things with computers .
there &apos;s one community of children in southern india whose english pronunciation is really bad , and they needed good pronunciation because that would improve their jobs .
so i asked this girl , &quot; can you help them ? &quot; so she says , &quot; absolutely not .
what an achievement that is .
i &apos;ve seen them do it from a village called diggles in northwestern england , deep inside a village in tamil nadu , india , 6,000 miles away .
we &apos;ve brought it down to the tangent of an angle .
if you would please , please do it across all five continents and send me the data , then i &apos;ll put it all together , move it into the school of clouds , and create the future of learning .
sometimes i startle myself : i &apos;ll forget that i have it on , and i &apos;ll lean over to pick up something , and then it goes like -- -- &quot; oh ! &quot;
in this soaring demonstration , deaf percussionist evelyn glennie illustrates how listening to music involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your eardrums .
and so on . my career would probably last about five years .
and so on . if i think of myself as a musician ...
no circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .
so it may be that , in certain halls , this dynamic may well work .
but that doesn &apos;t mean i have the right to say it &apos;s a bad piece of music .
listen , listen , listen . now -- what can we do with thunder ?
and by saying something through music , which basically is sound , we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people .
sometimes i wake up in the middle of the night and i scream , &quot; 4chan ! &quot;
rule one is you don &apos;t talk about / b / .
so we &apos;ve got this activist group that &apos;s this grassroots group that &apos;s come out of the site .
don &apos;t tell .
cp : i stuck that thread so it lasted a few days .
as i said , i just went back to school , and i am considering majoring in urban studies
looking at dinosaur evolution and studying it , digging it up for many years , i end up looking at the mammal radiation , and it seems as though everything is quick time , just like technology , advancing by an order of magnitude .
at the bottom of the cliff , we find that they &apos;re rare as hens &apos; teeth .
well , they &apos;re composed of people who understand science as adventure with a purpose .
it &apos;s only been with us for less than a century , and in that time , that fourth dimension , when radioactive dating came about , less than a century ago , and we could actually tell how old some of these things were , is probably the most profound transformation , because it changes the way we look at ourselves and the world dramatically .
narrator : ... as long as their boat .
we proved with those measurements that crocodiles scaled isometrically .
and so , in addition to digging , i think we have some answers from the dinosaur record . i think these dinosaurs migrated -- we call it dispersal -- around the globe , with the slightest land bridge .
i became an artist . o.k. , and started drawing .
but when we look back at our own country , we &apos;re looking back at our cities , the cities where most of you come from -- certainly the city i come from -- there &apos;s legions of kids out there like these .
and as a little girl , i loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful , trusted sidekick -- something that would delight us , enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two .
matt berlin : hello , leo .
but with the robot , you can .
so it seems like this physical , social embodiment actually really makes a difference .
and then it could help track that for you .
my sons , they love the screen . they love the screen .
i think that &apos;s very , very important .
but the under-underdog hangs tough ,
the mayans and aztecs engaged , which is why there are very few mayans and aztecs .
they have fangs , they have claws , they have nimbleness , they have speed .
a couple years ago , emily baer signed up for a race called the hardrock 100 , which tells you all you need to know about the race .
so what if we evolved as hunting pack animals ?
it &apos;s a really compelling argument that maybe the tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years ,
stop focusing on urban marathons , which , if you do four hours , you suck .
and it &apos;s about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture , and the importance of the image :
and this was a sequence of images .
very few of us know the real people --
and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth , and only showing certain angles to create a reality that , obviously , is completely constructed .
should i do advertising ? -- at the time .
and i think it doesn &apos;t really matter that my work is considered humorous , in a way ; i think it &apos;s a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery and how we read all our information through imagery .
chris anderson : thank you .
by the time you get to 50 , it &apos;s almost no one left in nigeria --
you can &apos;t depend on foreign aid alone .
let me lead you through a day in the life of the heart institute ,
we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology .
80 percent of u.s. practices do not have them , and yet the technology is there .
indirectly , we have saved the government of jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to miami or atlanta for care .
who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care ?
and i want to talk to you now about different ways of thinking .
so , what is thinking in pictures ? it &apos;s literally movies in your head .
that was like just so super cool .
and there in the background is the pattern for folding it .
you have another horse , where maybe the horseshoer beat him up
now , here is a horse that was deathly afraid of black cowboy hats .
and he studied alzheimer &apos;s patients that had frontal temporal lobe dementia .
my mother said , &quot; well let &apos;s do a picture of something else . &quot;
but we need to be getting some of these good teachers into the high schools .
tg : well , first of all , you &apos;ve got to look at age .
and server farms , or data centers are great libraries of knowledge .
okay .
now on the surface , this makes a lot of sense , and in 2010 , we responded to the tsunami in chile , the floods in pakistan , we sent training teams to the thai-burma border .
going back , that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school in kansas city , missouri , joins the army , the army gives him a rifle , they send him to iraq .
let &apos;s start here .
even the printing press , even the printing press was assumed to be a tool that was going to enforce catholic intellectual hegemony across europe .
better arguing ? that &apos;s the question .
when you adopt a tool , you also adopt the management philosophy embedded in that tool , and he wasn &apos;t going to adopt anything that didn &apos;t work the way the linux community worked .
it &apos;s an open-source programming language , and all of the interconnections between the people -- this is now not a software graph , but a people graph , all of the interconnections among the people working on that project — and this doesn &apos;t look like an org chart .
the stuff in red is the stuff that got deleted .
a new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes , in the last decade , in fact .
wherever anybody else looks , look somewhere else , and go do something different , you know , and doing that .
but i said i &apos;m going to show you a short clip of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea about some of the talent that we have .
why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved ?
this is one very large crater . geologists love craters , because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground without really working at it , and you can see what &apos;s below the surface .
you know , one of them , one of the wheels is stuck , is not working ,
and as you can see , this is a picture of the spacecraft put on mars , but i thought that just in case you &apos;re going to miss that show , you know , in 17 days , i &apos;ll show you , kind of , a little bit of what &apos;s going to happen .
the fabric and the stitching could just pull apart .
so it will be a very tense moment , you know , as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet .
and then we back off , you know , from that point .
but for scientists , also the rings have a special meaning , because we believe they represent , on a small scale , how the solar system actually formed .
so this is a yellowstone , you know , of saturn .
so here we have a cycle of a planet which is like our earth , but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material .
what i &apos;d like to talk about today is understanding these exponential technologies .
we have the ability to do more powerful things with them .
and of course , there &apos;s an app for that .
you can step on the scale .
how about augmenting the physician ?
you can swallow this completely integrated device .
we &apos;re now approaching essentially a thousand-dollar genome --
we can be preventative ; that prevention can be personalized ; and more importantly , it &apos;s going to become increasingly participatory .
we &apos;ve been actually using adult stem cells now in clinical trials for about 15 years to approach a whole range of topics , particularly in cardiovascular disease .
aaron o &apos;connell : making sense of a visible quantum object
and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
the rest of the time they &apos;re delocalized .
i was sort of astonished to find out how many i have actually .
it actually happened right at the time we met .
not excrement merely , not merely surface and orifice going unwashed , rediffusion of rum , there was will in it , and intention , power and purpose -- a social , ethical rage and rebellion --
60 nearly , yet these hardly tangible , hardly better than harlots , can still stir me .
but i think we &apos;re looking for something more .
so when we are confronted by a powerful image , we all have a choice :
this is me . my name is ben saunders .
i &apos;d read lots of books . i studied maps and charts .
the first one was reaching the pole itself .
at first it was pretty sensible . we flew british airways to moscow .
i was skiing into headwinds for nine out of the 10 weeks i was alone last year , and i was drifting backwards most of the time .
the wireless telescope was a digital camera i had tucked in my pocket .
i dialed my girlfriend . i dialed the ceo of my sponsor .
i was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment .
why ? i &apos;m not an explorer in the traditional sense .
every south pole expedition you may have heard about is either flown out from the pole or has used vehicles or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing -- no one has ever made a return journey . so that &apos;s the plan .
&quot; oh , don &apos;t worry about it , &quot; he said .
so i looked carefully at this guy .
and i think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us , and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it , but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors , because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances .
so maybe that &apos;s why we think of fear , sometimes , as a danger in and of itself .
now the last option was the longest , and the most difficult : to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of south america .
in fear , just like in fiction , one thing always leads to another .
why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other ?
well , one or two brave souls .
but i &apos;m a scientist and i don &apos;t like to make data out of anecdotes , so let &apos;s look at some data .
so , suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles .
are we any more rational about sex ?
and , again , it &apos;s because of an alignment of the incentives .
and the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of hiv as they were of aids , and rightly so .
this is what factory workers earn in an hour in indonesia : on average , 20 cents .
as a democratic revolution led by tech-empowered young people sweeps the arab world , wadah khanfar , the head of al jazeera , shares a profoundly optimistic view of what &apos;s happening in egypt , tunisia , libya and beyond -- at this powerful moment when people realized they could step out of their houses and ask for change .
now i am here to tell you that the future that we were dreaming for has eventually arrived .
yes , some of these young people are connected to the internet , but the connectivity in the arab world is very little , is very small , because of many problems that we are suffering from .
al jazeera is not a tool of revolution .
how would you characterize the historical significance of what &apos;s happened ?
they &apos;ve had some speakers there .
down below , there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule .
it &apos;s called claw-hammer style , that he had learned from his mother and grandmother .
it was hard on the cats , but it made a great little instrument .
my brother and i stepped out of the car .
now , my brother and i had never heard anything like that in our whole lives . it was so beautiful .
there &apos;s a starry crown in heaven , i know .
break it off , put it on your finger , and slide into the notes .
sometimes i think it &apos;s better just to sink way down in your funky mood &apos; til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues .
we weren &apos;t stupid : we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it .
when drum machines were new , i got to thinking , why couldn &apos;t you take the oldest form of music , the hambone rhythms , and combine it with the newest technology ?
on the other hand , somehow we manage to reason together as a community , from incomplete evidence to conclusions that we all agree about .
their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand , and a society on the other hand , were closely related .
they ’ re thinking about the same things .
21st-century science is going to be driven by the integration of these two ideas : the triumph of relational ways of thinking about the world , on the one hand , and self-organization or darwinian ways of thinking about the world , on the other hand .
and i get , over time , bored by them .
it &apos;s a wonderful , very craft-oriented society .
and at the same time , i &apos;m extremely aware how boring it is to hear about other people &apos;s happinesses .
when i had the idea of doing one , the process was i made the decision and i put it into my daily planner book .
and mostly also because i realized out of a rem koolhaas presentation to the city of porto , where he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning .
second insight . so far , until that point i had been mostly involved or used the language of design for promotional purposes ,
while we built all this up during that week , with the 100 volunteers , a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza got very close to it and quite loved it .
i &apos;m happy i &apos;m alive . i &apos;m happy i &apos;m alive .
water &apos;s pumped from the lake and is filtered and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles , 35,000 of them . and a weather station is on the structure .
and this is the highest honor to be bestowed upon an architect in switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar .
in any case , the way it works is that an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls .
this elevator &apos;s about the size of a new york city studio apartment .
and we asked ourselves , why couldn &apos;t it be exhibitionistic , like the met , or like some of the other buildings at lincoln center ?
but it &apos;s acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house and back to the stage . and here &apos;s an acoustic shelf .
we &apos;re going to kind of go in a different direction right now .
everybody likes to have their own animal that they named .
they put them in foam , little containers . they &apos;re very well taken care of .
you can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities .
the dome , that little dome , is growing really fast .
and that &apos;s pretty cool .
the bone histology tells us that edmontosaurus is a juvenile , or at least a sub-adult , and the other one is an adult and we have an ontogeny .
&lt; transcript &gt;
thank you . bruno &apos;s face , just then , he said , &quot; no , don &apos;t go through this . don &apos;t , please don &apos;t .
and there he is .
that reminds me , i must post that letter . &quot;
&quot; and now it &apos;s got a hangover . &quot;
i think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing , wouldn &apos;t it ?
and we all want to believe in president obama .
&quot; tell a lie ; it was diana ross ... &quot;
&lt; transcript &gt;
it is also important for the environment , because the world &apos;s energy requirements are expected to grow by 30 percent in the next decade .
and when i went out to meet the press , they zeroed in , said , &quot; why are you wearing that snake pin ? &quot;
and i said , &quot; well i &apos;ve been a woman for 60 years , but i &apos;ve only been secretary of state for a few minutes . &quot;
i think that they thought that it was a soft issue .
if you think that , you &apos;ve forgotten high school .
i think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other .
if your bank account &apos;s one dollar , and you flip a single bit , you could end up with a thousand dollars .
there are other questions like this , too .
but to do it , you need a long , single strand of dna , which is technically very difficult to get .
so , they &apos;re all floating around in solution , and to look at them , you have to get them on a surface where they stick .
now , this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer , so we have a long way to go .
and in order to get these kinds of computations started right , you need some kind of input , a kind of seed .
and so we can exponentially reduce the number of dna strands we use , if we use counting , if we use a little bit of computation .
what it &apos;s really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light , asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things . thank you .
for those from the developing world , there is nothing , absolutely nothing new in this idea .
often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in that leads him to pay a bribe .
i propose to explore this idea further , to examine the potential of creating a for-profit , fee-based bpo kind of service to stop bribes and prevent corruption .
so you take the next step , or use the next tool available in what we are putting together , and then he relents .
let me begin with an example .
to serve other people , not to manipulate other people .
the emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood . and they were ready to let the kid go .
moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules that deprives us of the opportunity to improvise and learn from our improvisations .
right ?
but excessive reliance on incentives demoralizes professional activity in two senses of that word .
why ? because it would have been a disaster for them and for the community if he had let them go .
if you run an organization , you should be sure that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs -- have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors .
i think people want to be allowed to be virtuous .
they have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers .
so , i decided we &apos;ve got to do this .
he &apos;s punching our controls guy . the guy behind him is our engineer / surgeon , which is a convenient guy to have around .
&quot; well , would it help if i ... &quot;
he &apos;s got no legs . he &apos;s got no arms .
i &apos;ll shut up , except one message
i &apos;ve never seen a bird flying around at mach 2 .
narrator : and so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
so this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented ted community .
i would later find out that was houdini &apos;s personal record . in 1987 i heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river .
so , i got my hands on that chemical , filled the sink up with it , and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in , which was really impossible .
and you &apos;re really ridding your body of co2 .
and by eating so well and training so hard , my resting heart-rate dropped to 38 beats per minute .
i realized that my real competition was the beaver .
and i did a dive down to 160 feet , which is basically the height of a 16 story building , and as i was coming up , i blacked out underwater , which is really dangerous ; that &apos;s how you drown .
and i knew that that was blood shunting , when the blood rushes away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs .
as though that wasn &apos;t enough , what i did immediately after is i went to quest labs and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were , so the doctors could use it , once again .
matt mills : now , what &apos;s great about this is , there &apos;s no trickery here .
okay . so , as we &apos;re talking about cambridge , let &apos;s now move on to technical advancements , because since we started putting this technology on mobile phones less than 12 months ago , the speed and the processing in these devices has grown at a really phenomenal rate , and that means that i can now take cinema-quality 3d models and place them in the world around me , so i have one over here .
mm : fellows are really good at that .
: man : ... extremely dangerous questions .
that &apos;s why they migrate to cities .
for us , where does it take us , as social activists and entrepreneurs ?
do you remember , 20 years ago , no one had ever heard of west nile fever ?
today , there &apos;s another kind of movement . it &apos;s a movement to save the earth .
in the summer of love , in 1967 , two million people , children , died of smallpox .
the first wave of evolution is what we think of as darwinian evolution .
this is the largest cat in the world -- the lion-tiger hybrid .
other states have banned them .
a somatic cell , a body cell , was taken from its body , gestated in the ovum of a cow , and then that cow gave birth to a guar .
so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth , it is already prewired .
they self-aggregated into a network , became an integrated chip .
for the first time in the history of this planet , we are able to directly design organisms .
he was raised by very supportive and interested parents .
and for many decades now there have been a series of toms satellites that have collected data about the radiation of the earth &apos;s surface .
and has been recruited over and over again by evolution , as often happens .
a remarkable , remarkable testament to the power of evolution .
we live in a world where we have lightly and darkly pigmented people living next to one another ,
spread the word .
some of them are artificial .
they were done on a computer ,
now look at that . that &apos;s a real lung .
and at the end , you get things like that .
so it was in 1875 to 1925 , an extraordinary period in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world .
and amazing .
and it went really well 50 years ago .
and like the thousands of people that had tried before , i found nothing .
it &apos;s so complicated .
now , you could ask this question , why were the doctors doing this ?
now comes the between-subjects design , the ab design , the ab testing .
anyone ? it &apos;s much more difficult .
remember , the deck was stacked against you .
and that made so much of a difference in terms of the peace of mind that came with that , we could focus on her recovery .
only seven percent of arable land in africa is irrigated , compared to 40 percent in asia .
like its agriculture , africa &apos;s markets are highly under-capitalized and inefficient .
and we calculated that some 300,000 tons of grain was left in the fields to rot in early 2002 .
well , the need to avoid these huge risks and tremendous losses led to the birth of the futures market , and the underlying system of grading grain and receipting -- issuing warehouse receipts on the basis of which trade could be done .
because we don &apos;t think the country &apos;s ready for full electronic trading .
ecx , moreover , can become a trading platform for a pan-african market in agricultural commodities .
that &apos;s a cyclical process .
the dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year .
all we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid , and then excavate the sand , and we have our architecture .
we then pull the piles up through the dune and we &apos;re able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand with the sand acting as a mold as we go up .
now , there are many details left to explore in this scheme -- political , practical , ethical , financial .
so i did just that .
humorist john hodgman rambles through a new story about aliens , physics , time , space and the way all of these somehow contribute to a sweet , perfect memory of falling in love .
isn &apos;t it a little convenient that in the midst of the world war , out of nowhere , suddenly an italian scientist showed up with an amazing new technology that would transform everything in the world and darken the history of the human species forever after ?
and then they stopped , and the man turned to me and said , &quot; what are you looking for , flying saucers ? &quot;
i went with my friend tim mcgonigal , who sat on my left .
he could never leave the tank or interact with the outside world .
something odd ? something off ? something wrong with this picture ?
she was smiling .
the stars aligned , and she came back .
and the view of scientists about how coral reefs work , how they ought to be , was based on these reefs without any fish .
and the reason it keeps getting worse is that after a natural catastrophe , like a hurricane , some kind of successional sequence of recovery , but what &apos;s going on now is that overfishing and pollution and climate change are all interacting in a way that prevents that .
and that &apos;s everywhere .
it &apos;s very pretty , and it has rapidly started to overgrow the once very rich biodiversity of the northwestern mediterranean .
that &apos;s the same species .
and , of course , arctic communities are toast .
and dead zones will get bigger and bigger and they &apos;ll start to merge ,
and hope actually is at the heart of this .
maybe we can even go further and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere , which is what we &apos;re going to need to be doing by the end of the century .
adam smith , 200 years ago , spoke about our desire for a life without shame .
keynes called this the &quot; paradox of thrift &quot; -- saving slows down recovery .
or might we actually occasionally be something like the selfless altruist depicted in rembrandt &apos;s lovely , lovely sketch here ?
we can just put in a little search term .
so let me come back , with this sense of hope , to the two billion people still trying to live each day on less than the price of a skinny latte from the cafe next door .
you &apos;re making news out of the things that tell you that we &apos;re flourishing .
and we don &apos;t really understand what oil is , until you check out its molecules ,
it triples the amount of oily , messy goo that you have in the water , and it makes it very hard to handle .
it is green . it is a shrine to greenishness .
and it also the kind of root of how we see oil as a conspiracy .
everything that we are really stemmed from this period .
they have degrees in political science , degrees in business --
so the people of the gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us through a less-clean environment .
we need to have more mobility choices .
we need to keep or minds on the molecules and not get distracted by the theater , not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance of the green possibilities that are out there .
people watch it all over the country also in public places .
they don &apos;t sing pop songs , they sing afghan music .
and the most immediate thought when i came out of that water was the following : i &apos;m never , ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again .
when you &apos;re trying to do that , and then the bodies are coming past you , it humbles you , and you also realize very , very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are .
every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming , you must forget .
because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
this is called the registry of standard biological parts .
on the right , that &apos;s a radiolara .
so we &apos;ve tracked in the video the input string , which was green , green , yellow , yellow , green .
so can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site ?
i &apos;m going to segue a little here .
this is a kite designed by a guy called dave kulp .
so if we &apos;re seriously talking about tackling climate change on an urbanizing planet , we need to look somewhere else for the solution .
and this is a huge , huge energy savings ,
and while we could try and figure out new ways to use those capacities -- such as cooking or making ice sculptures or even a mafia hit -- what we probably will find is that , in fact , turning those products into services that we have access to when we want them , is a far smarter way to go .
i would submit to you that all of these things are not only possible , they &apos;re being done right now , and that it &apos;s a darn good thing .
for example , any social history will reveal that mutilation and torture were routine forms of criminal punishment . the kind of infraction today that would give you a fine , in those days would result in your tongue being cut out , your ears being cut off , you being blinded , a hand being chopped off and so on .
&quot; i don &apos;t really want to kill that guy , but he &apos;s about to kill me .
.
and really this is about the bedroom .
but if i would change this axis here , i would instead put income per person .
because in fact , this is child labor . my son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this .
which have great entrepreneurs , but also have the collapsing countries .
they have been saving , you know , over the last decade .
and then it &apos;s united states today , up here .
we have a continuum . but we still have , of course , congo , up there . we still have as poor countries as we have had , always , in history .
brazil here has amazing social improvement over the last 16 years ,
the size of the bubbles is how many are hiv affected .
make it a local issue . and do prevention at each place , in the way it can be done there .
it &apos;s not sustainable , and it will not happen around one superpower .
damien runs a hotel outside of kinshasa .
but if what we &apos;re really trying to do is stop the spread of hiv , we need to think about the customer , the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples , the young women , the young men -- whose lives depend on it .
and amazingly , that evolution sustains the trajectory that biological evolution had established toward greater complexity .
you have them in hunter-gatherer societies , but then through technological evolution , new forms of technology arise that facilitate or encourage the playing of non-zero-sum games , involving more people over larger territory .
it is non-zero-sum . and by that i mean , if people in the muslim world get more hateful , more resentful , less happy with their place in the world , it &apos;ll be bad for the west . if they get more happy , it &apos;ll be good for the west .
there &apos;s going to have to be a lessening of the amount of hatred in the world , given how dangerous it &apos;s becoming .
you don &apos;t want to say , &quot; well , yeah , i can kind of understand how a human being in those circumstances would hate the country i live in . &quot; that &apos;s not a pleasant thing , but i think it &apos;s something that we &apos;re going to have to get used to and work on . now , i want to stress that to understand , you know -- there are people who don &apos;t like this whole business of understanding the grassroots , the root causes of things ; they don &apos;t want to know why people hate us . i want to understand it .
i have listened to the three previous speakers , and guess what happened ?
the wrong framing is a product of thinking that africa is a place of despair .
they are throwing large sums of money for primary health , for primary education , for food relief .
aid is the bad instrument , and do you know why ?
but i want to put a caveat on my argument , and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive .
trade and industry takes 43 billion .
so i said , &quot; well , how many words do i get ? &quot;
that we could create a classification of the mental illnesses .
you can ask , how do you stack up for positive emotion , for meaning , for flow , against literally tens of thousands of other people ?
that &apos;s what aristotle was talking about .
len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities .
so , that &apos;s the second path . the first path , positive emotion .
when you do something philanthropic to help another person , it lasts and it lasts .
and so , the parallel thing holds with technology , entertainment and design , i believe . that is , it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness , to increase positive emotion , and that &apos;s typically how they &apos;ve been used .
shot straight down , so these are the shadows of the camels .
and he said , &quot; oh , yeah , i remember that too !
and a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den .
we were looking at the same issue that richard wurman touches upon in his new world population project .
photography can also compel us to confront issues that are potentially distressing and controversial .
she &apos;s probably -- it &apos;s a shame you can &apos;t see it in the photograph , but she &apos;s 12 feet long .
&lt; transcript &gt;
when i finished , i went to the ituri forest for my internship .
on their way , they looted everything .
that is people moving around , that &apos;s even pygmies .
with friends , we had been sitting and watching match football , and having some good music with worldspace radio , when it started , i think .
they used me to carry that , and i was doing counting , what comes from where , and where , and where .
and during the war , after a week of heavy war , fighting in the area , we succeeded : we had the first okapi .
i think we see the war like a game -- like soccer , football .
they can &apos;t even attain the bachelor &apos;s degree .
if you take the difference between these two images here , you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light of just the shine off of emily &apos;s skin .
and you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates .
and i say believe because this process is still ongoing .
so descend into huautla plateau in mexico .
it was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects .
there are two primary targets we &apos;re doing here .
there are three underpinnings of working in space privately .
the way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground , and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces .
in seven years , we could pull off an industrial mission to shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit .
ok .
i have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure .
so , when i look at creativity , i also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress , my looking at associations in practically anything in life .
a very famous chinese saying , she said .
and when i have the question , it is a focus .
sometimes i get help from the universe , it seems .
and it was a man , a chinese man , and he was stacking these things , not with glue , not with anything .
and so i was there on three occasions , different seasons .
i have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that .
tv and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way .
imagine what the world was like 40 years ago when it was just the saturday evening post and time and newsweek .
and that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going .
now he &apos;s in london , and he ships by fedex all around the world .
this yoyo right here cost 112 dollars , but it sleeps for 12 minutes .
and one person at a time , the idea spreads .
they didn &apos;t triple their sales with advertising ; they tripled it by doing something remarkable .
i would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for national geographic magazine .
this problem has continued to grow each year since i was there .
i also , with the story , wanted to show readers how fish are caught , some of the methods that are used to catch fish , like a bottom trawler , which is one of the most common methods in the world .
this is a low-altitude photograph that i made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind .
after i left bimini , i actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort .
this photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of florida .
and i really wanted this story to be about three things :
&lt; / transcript &gt;
now i &apos;m not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the black death .
there was a very sick orangutan baby , my first encounter .
people spent so much of their money on health issues and drinking water .
what we did was we formulated recipes -- how to go from a starting situation where you have nothing to a target situation .
may .
and if you zoom in a bit you can see that all of this area is divided into strips that go over different types of soil , and we were actually monitoring , measuring every single tree in these 2,000 hectares , 5,000 acres .
and then slowly , the trees start taking over , bringing in produce from the fruits , from the timber , from the fuel wood .
in the tropics , raindrops are not formed from ice crystals , which is the case in the temperate zones , you need the trees with &#91; unclear &#93; , chemicals that come out of the leaves of the trees that initiate the raindrops .
they have enough income for three families .
but we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities . i &apos;m working in cities for almost 40 years , and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big ,
market street , van ness and the waterfront .
it &apos;s not enough , a new materials . it &apos;s not enough , new sources of energy .
i &apos;m working in a museum and also a multi-use city , because you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day .
it &apos;s important starting and having the contribution from people , and they could teach you if you &apos;re not in the right track .
and i think if people don &apos;t believe it , they should get out more . but i believe there &apos;s a second climate crisis , which is as severe , which has the same origins , and that we have to deal with with the same urgency .
you have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .
and many of our ideas have been formed , not to meet the circumstances of this century , but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries .
as she says , &quot; it &apos;s a single function device . &quot;
this one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
see , it &apos;s outrageous as a conception , but it &#91; unclear &#93; .
you know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
thank you .
and they did it in a total devotion to non-violence .
so we all know the three o &apos;clock in the morning syndrome , when something you &apos;ve been worrying about wakes you up -- i see a lot of people -- and for an hour you toss and turn , it gets worse and worse , and by four o &apos;clock you &apos;re pinned to the pillow by a monster this big .
and they &apos;re doing what they think is best .
and chris hughes strode into the middle of the throng with his weapon above his head , pointing at the ground , and he said , &quot; kneel . &quot; and these huge soldiers with their backpacks and their body armor , wobbled to the ground .
we can bring to an end the bloodiest century that humanity has ever known .
it is dimensionless . it is limitless .
you can see i don &apos;t do much . i &apos;m just standing there , again with my eyes closed , and other people are molding me , evidential .
i think of it as a 21st-century buddha .
at his carpet company , ray anderson has increased sales and doubled profits while turning the traditional &quot; take / make / waste &quot; industrial system on its head . in a gentle , understated way , he shares a powerful vision for sustainable commerce .
and theft of our children &apos;s future would someday be a crime .
in the new industrial revolution extractive must be replaced by renewable ; linear by cyclical ; fossil fuel energy by renewable energy , sunlight ;
three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home , under the brand flor , misspelled f-l-o-r .
there is a dip there , from 2001 to 2003 : a dip when our sales , over a three-year period , were down 17 percent .
if we can actually do it , it must be possible .
tomorrow &apos;s child , my daughter , son , i &apos;m afraid i &apos;ve just begun to think of you and of your good , though always having known i should .
and now , a typical university entering student arrives at college already having spent 20,000 hours online and an additional 10,000 hours playing video games -- a stark reminder that we operate in a cultural context where video games now outsell music and movie recordings combined .
now , go to youtube , facebook ; you have worldwide distribution without leaving the privacy of your own bedroom .
we work to promote healthy vibrant societies , to ameliorate human suffering , to promote a more thoughtful , substantive , empathic world order .
bill strickland makes change with a slide show
well , we don &apos;t make any steel anymore , and the people who used to make the steel are having a very tough time of it .
that we have quilts and clay and calligraphy and everywhere your eye turns , there &apos;s something beautiful looking back at you ,
we &apos;ve heard about your work with the kids and the ex-steel workers , and we &apos;re inclined to want to support your desire to build a new building .
it &apos;s all in the way that you think about people that often determines their behavior .
well , i went out and decided to reproduce my experience with other kids in the neighborhood , the theory being if you get kids flowers and you give them food and you give them sunshine and enthusiasm , you can bring them right back to life .
i can &apos;t get these parents to come to the school . &quot;
and i said , &quot; well , there &apos;s an easy solution to that problem . &quot;
and joe williams came up to me and he put his hand on my shoulder and he said , &quot; god &apos;s picked you , man , to do this work . and i want my music to be with you . &quot;
and that &apos;s the building , and that &apos;s the model , and on the right &apos;s a high-tech greenhouse and in the middle &apos;s the medical technology building .
and said , &quot; mr. strickland , you ought to get the civic leader of the year award because you &apos;ve appreciated our property values beyond our wildest expectations .
and along the way , i met this real short guy at my slide show in the silicon valley .
but i met a guy named quincy jones along the way and i showed him the box of slides .
in my business it &apos;s very difficult work . you &apos;re always fighting upstream like a salmon -- never enough money , too much need --
well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life .
the question that we had is how can bacteria , these primitive organisms , tell the difference from times when they &apos;re alone , and times when they &apos;re in a community , and then all do something together .
and as the day goes by the bacteria double , they release the molecule , and then light comes on at night , exactly when the squid wants it .
the left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria .
it &apos;s a very small , five-carbon molecule .
the hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics
this is exactly what happens in your body .
information . that is , how it takes information in from the outside world , and converts it into patterns of electrical activity , and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things -- to see , hear , to reach for an object .
so , a solution to the problem , then , would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front-end circuitry and send signals to the retina &apos;s output cells , and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain .
so i &apos;m just going to show you one bottom-line experiment that answers this , and of course i &apos;ve got a lot of other data , so if you &apos;re interested i &apos;m happy to show more . so the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and if not , stuxnet does nothing .
and that worked pretty well .
down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the centrifuges .
just spread it as wide as possible .
if you think about the arguments we have ,
ms : the worst flute players .
he was a very good golfer , but he had a disability .
ms : charlie says --
and what do you suppose they all said ?
but since it is the very nature of a game to have no object except amusement , that is , what distinguishes games from productive activity , it is quite impossible to say that any of a game &apos;s arbitrary rules is essential . &quot;
the opponents of same-sex marriage say that the purpose of marriage , fundamentally , is procreation ,
in the classroom , we have arguments on some of the most fiercely held moral convictions that students have about big public questions .
namely , essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed , to get sick in the first place .
these are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging .
and the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks .
we &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , rna interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
you can look at medical care . i mean , hygiene , vaccines , antibiotics -- you know , the same sort of time frame .
and in order to do that , i need to talk about mice a little bit .
that will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans , since it &apos;s been postponed so very effectively in mice .
the list on the right is also incomplete .
so , you know , you &apos;ve got to actually do your homework , in order to understand whether this is true .
so , to the extent that evolution doesn &apos;t matter , doesn &apos;t care whether genes are passed on by individuals , living a long time or by procreation , there &apos;s a certain amount of modulation of that , which is why different species have different lifespans , but that &apos;s why there are no immortal species .
but in the last couple of years we &apos;ve become infamous for a couple of things .
what does that mean ?
einstein said that this was the definition of insanity -- to do the same things over and over again , hoping for a different outcome .
so we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge . the final thought i want to leave with you is that i &apos;m fed up with this tyranny of either / or choices in life -- either it &apos;s men or it &apos;s women .
external debt -- something that i can tell you a long story about because i personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent -- has come down dramatically .
like in every other country where this has been done , jobs is the top issue .
i don &apos;t think that africans need to now go all the way over to the other side and feel bad about aid .
well , i was in the middle of it .
in about two to three hours , she started to move .
resources that were transferred to them -- and were the spanish ashamed of this ? no !
but i &apos;m not really sure that their assistance is also being channeled in the right way .
ten years from now we will have the same story , and we will be repeating the same things .
you are undisciplined . &quot;
we have ibukun awosika in nigeria , with the chair company .
and so why don &apos;t we go and click the video .
i think that neuroscientists have many more questions than answers ,
we actually have to come up with a scientific experiment .
as i like to say , these are not the &quot; jazz areas &quot; of the brain .
the fact that we do it over and over again lets you acclimate to your surroundings .
and so this is what you do : you have a free-style artist come in and memorize a rap that you write for them , that they &apos;ve never heard before , and then you have them free-style .
you have heightened brain activity when you &apos;re doing a comparable task , when that one task is creative and the other task is memorized .
on the other hand , statistics -- that &apos;s a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . right ?
and what better way to do this than by interpreting the signals naturally produced by our brain , our center for control and experience .
so facial expressions -- as i mentioned before in emotional experiences -- are actually designed to work out of the box with some sensitivity adjustments available for personalization .
so we have a little bit of time available , so i &apos;m going to ask evan to do a really difficult task .
and moving on to some applications developed by developers and researchers around the world , with robots and simple machines , for example -- in this case , flying a toy helicopter simply by thinking &quot; lift &quot; with your mind .
the two are related because the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn &apos;t fun , you wouldn &apos;t have the time to do it .
so the inside of this thing actually looks like a coke machine .
it &apos;s got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle ;
it creates a very high peak power
this is malaria spreading across madagascar .
your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer that &apos;s used to steer a laser beam very accurately ;
but the female needs the blood meal .
here we have it running at high-speed mode .
and i &apos;ve spent a long time , 25 years , preparing these .
if they &apos;re not working , put a shelf on it , which i did ,
this is the waste room .
and it &apos;s run on hydroelectricity , so i &apos;ve gone from air to water .
really important .
so , i &apos;m an artist .
and it just takes a quick , quick second .
and i don &apos;t know , i think this project has a lot of possibilities , and i encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day , so you can never forget that that day , you lived .
this is a new generation , a new family , which is able to store the winds .
and what &apos;s very important is this tube . it sucks in air normally , but when it swallows water , it feels the resistance of it .
it also is the first species to have its own website encoded in its genetic code .
there were several steps to this . there were two sides :
and we thought this would be a great test bed for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast and transplant them .
so , we thought the worst problem would be a single molecule contamination of the native chromosome , leading us to believe that we actually had created a synthetic cell , when it would have been just a contaminant .
the last thing i want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we &apos;ve done -- asking for ethical review , pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side -- this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community , in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government .
we can &apos;t see co2 -- we depend on scientific measurements for it and we see the beginning results of having too much of it --
my last book was about the story behind the shi &apos;a-sunni split , and for that i &apos;d worked closely with the earliest islamic histories ,
and where the bible is addressed exclusively to men , using the second and third person masculine , the koran includes women -- talking , for instance , of believing men and believing women , honorable men and honorable women .
paradise is quite the opposite .
and every colony has a name , which is a number , which is painted on a rock . and i go there every year and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before , and figure out which ones have died , and put all the new ones on the map .
they make a midden , a pile of refuse -- mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat .
that is , that there are chambers inside , they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it .
that is to say , if something happened -- and i &apos;ve never seen anything like this happen , but i &apos;ve only been looking for 20 years -- if something happened , they might all come out if they were needed .
then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked .
this process changes with colony age , and it changes like this .
but first you might be wondering : how is it that an ant can tell , for example , i &apos;m a forager .
again , i don &apos;t want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork .
and what &apos;s interesting about it isn &apos;t the cost ; it &apos;s the way it encodes the internet .
von neumann , in the &apos; 50s , did the same thing for computing ;
you know , hundreds of people came in begging , all my life i &apos;ve been waiting for this class ; i &apos;ll do anything to do it .
the students hijacked all the machines i bought to do personal fabrication .
they invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box -- which , as you see up there , that &apos;s becoming a business -- but their design was better than saul &apos;s design at mit , so there &apos;s now three students at mit doing their theses on scaling the work of eight-year-old children because they had better designs .
the real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems .
a hundred years ago we were looking at coal , of course , and we were looking at whale oil and we were looking at crude oil .
are we smarter than anybody else ? i &apos;m not sure .
if you go forward the next 10 years and cap the price of oil at 100 dollars a barrel , you will pay 2.2 trillion .
how does that translate to barrels of oil equivalent ?
if that &apos;s the way you &apos;re going to go , that there &apos;s plenty of methane --
we found out that we could go to the source rock , which were the carboniferous shales in the basins .
but jim and i talked there as he left ,
you can &apos;t -- okay .
your picture then i guess of how the world eventually gets off fossil fuels is through innovation ultimately , that we &apos;ll someday make solar and nuclear cost competitive ?
i think there &apos;s a lot of people who will want to engage with you .
but they keep hearing about people getting rich , and then in 1850 they still hear that . and they think it &apos;s not real .
it got renamed the &quot; dead horse trail . &quot;
it &apos;s not a specific thing .
by the way , this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit .
and you &apos;d plug it in there .
but , you know , before i get too far into condemning our ancestors , i thought i &apos;d show you : this is my conference room .
because , you know , resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the gold rush , then you &apos;d be pretty depressed right now
so , i &apos;m going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language , and so it &apos;s not going to sound as warm and fuzzy as your average compassion talk .
again , i know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion as you may have heard in the past , but from a biologist &apos;s point of view , this reciprocal altruism kind of compassion is ultimately self-serving too .
we have the capacity to carve out exceptions , put people in a special category .
now , if you &apos;re playing doubles , then the person on your side of the net is in a non-zero-sum relationship with you , because every point is either good for both of you -- positive , win-win -- or bad for both of you , it &apos;s lose-lose .
and you compare that to the attitude now , i think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence .
that &apos;s good , but again we tend to deploy it selectively .
in oxford in the 1950s , there was a fantastic doctor , who was very unusual , named alice stewart .
and it flew in the face of doctors &apos; idea of themselves , which was as people who helped patients , they didn &apos;t harm them .
they saw it as thinking .
because it does take skill and practice , too .
it doesn &apos;t really matter what the statements are about , what matters is that the candidates are willing and able to stand up to authority .
and the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious .
and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain , so we got looking in the dry areas of the southwest .
then there &apos;s the point of embarkation , that is , the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest .
there &apos;s possibilities . the borders are important .
well , a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth , and by and by , thanks to mitch and jay , we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars .
way more interesting than monterey even today .
where there &apos;s a bit of a problem .
and it really is hidden . i can &apos;t find it in this image , and i &apos;m not sure you can .
he &apos;s trying to determine if where he is on a bit of long now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain .
you excavated from somewhere , came up from inside and deepened it .
i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting .
the color of movies and the way light makes the colors , light from behind the projection , or light from the projection , makes the colors look so impossible .
it &apos;s sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers .
i work with twyla tharp a lot , and i work with mark morris a lot , who is one of my best friends .
and if you ever get bored you can look at another thing , and do another thing and talk about it , right ?
and there &apos;s got to be some way to do that , rosie . because just because if you &apos;re fabulously rich , and fabulously famous , does that mean you shouldn &apos;t have kids , because you know they &apos;re going to end up getting messed up ?
and so i think that &apos;s what it all boils down to .
just because i don &apos;t know that whole -- that there &apos;s no such thing as whole buttermilk .
i want to share some of that story with you , but also some of my ideas around change and the role of social movements in creating change in muslim-majority societies .
at the age of 21 , i was co-founding this organization in pakistan .
and so they are pockets of parochialism that are being connected in a way that makes them feel like they are mainstream .
so the ideas and the narratives of al-qaeda come to your mind immediately .
and what happens as a result of this is , when those parties are elected , and inevitably they fail , or inevitably they make political mistakes , democracy takes the blame for their political mistakes .
without freedom of belief , you don &apos;t have the right to join organizations .
nandan nilekani , the visionary co-founder of outsourcing pioneer infosys , explains four brands of ideas that will determine whether india can continue its recent breakneck progress .
and i believe this change in the mindset , of looking at people as something of a burden to human capital , has been one of the fundamental changes in the indian mindset .
the next thing is technology .
for some reason , whatever reason -- lack of money , lack of priorities , because of religion having an older culture -- primary education was never given the focus it required .
again , an idea which is arrived , but not yet implemented .
at the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector , and create the jobs for the millions of people that we need to create jobs for .
on a population of nine billion our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
ok , this is the route up everest .
that way , it &apos;s less likely to tumble down on you .
everybody &apos;s on oxygen , your supplies are limited , and you either have to go up or go down , make that decision very quickly .
you can see on this climber , we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack -- little titanium tanks , very lightweight --
and we heard that rob was ok , but doug was too weak to come down .
so , as the climbers came by me , i sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition to continue on further down .
the survivors came in one by one .
after laying in the snow that long a time , he got up and found his way back to the camp .
there &apos;s very little red anywhere .
luckily , we were able to get a helicopter in to rescue these guys .
and plus , i &apos;m not going to give you any answers .
democracy is the only game in town .
and this is not the audience to which i &apos;m going to preach to what extent the internet empowered people .
and it &apos;s becoming more and more difficult to understand the people who are not like you .
this is why you have checks and balances .
&lt; transcript &gt;
i think when major h told me , i wasn &apos;t really totally gathering what that would mean .
soldiers : iv ! are we on fire ? iv !
i don &apos;t know how many of you might imagine it , but there &apos;s actually a tedster who recently got back from iraq .
i didn &apos;t save all of them , because i didn &apos;t realize at the beginning that it would be something that i would want to keep track of .
get your bag , get your bag !
i &apos;ll do that , then i &apos;m gonna jerk off .
i knew about that journal , but it was very , very private .
and usually , the first questions are , &quot; oh , what kind of cameras did you use ? &quot;
so when i talk about a disconnect , it &apos;s not only for maybe those people who don &apos;t know a soldier ,
this is what we call , in our lab , sensible design .
in a certain sense , it &apos;s almost as if the old dream of michelangelo ...
zidane , the headbutt in a moment .
and if we show that to people , then we can also promote some behavioral change .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
and those particles are water , where our cloud is a cloud of pixels .
yeah ? and then a swedish guy showed me my room .
i &apos;m going to be all right . &quot; qataris , you guys do the nose to nose .
even if i &apos;m there with my friend named jack , i say , &quot; greetings , jack . salutations , jack . &quot; never &quot; hi , jack . &quot; but now apparently we can &apos;t even talk about the safest place to sit on an airplane .
which is exactly what we &apos;ve done .
you probably had no idea . it &apos;s like driving around the world six times .
for me , today , on this date , it &apos;s like a second bar mitzvah experience .
but ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between , because it &apos;s a mechanical force .
and about four or five months ago , he underwent an experimental procedure .
so the first sonication is at lower energy .
i mean , those people lose their independence .
he took the treatment , and on the way back , he drove the truck by himself .
well , there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen -- quite lethal , very lethal actually -- pancreas , liver , kidney .
copyright law &apos;s grip on film , music and software barely touches the fashion industry ... and fashion benefits in both innovation and sales , says johanna blakley . at tedxusc 2010 , she talks about what all creative industries can learn from fashion &apos;s free culture .
and sometimes these are fun , right ?
so it &apos;s both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry .
and this , actually , is good news to trendsetters ;
i love these gallianos .
so , that does not stop the knock-off artists .
tattoo artists , they don &apos;t want it ; it &apos;s not cool .
the other one is : is it an idea ?
it also happens to be a relative of parsley .
and then , of course , there &apos;s the lichens .
imagine that it &apos;s one giant root system and each tree is a stem coming up from that system .
and there are actually a number or ancient yews in churchyards around the u.k. , but if you do the math , you &apos;ll remember it &apos;s actually the yew trees that were there first , then the churches .
it &apos;s bushfelt region , which is dry and prone to a lot of fires , as so what these trees have done is , if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree , and that this is ground level , imagine that the whole thing , that whole bulk of the tree , migrated underground , and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface .
i &apos;m trying to travel there to find 5,000 year-old moss , which lives on the antarctic peninsula .
i &apos;ve added my location with a google map , and it &apos;s live , so try moving it around .
mikko hypponen : three types of online attack
this is bjorn sundin .
now we all , or a big part of us , use gmail or one of their competitors , but these services are especially popular in totalitarian states like iran , where dissidents use foreign services like gmail because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services and they are encrypted over ssl connections , so the local government can &apos;t snoop on their discussions .
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
one woman i knew who was a fellow at a program that i ran at the rockefeller foundation was named ingrid washinawatok .
i also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership .
what we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other .
for two years , he hardly made any money , a tiny stipend , but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named tasneem saddiqui .
my final story is about a young , beautiful man named josephat byaruhanga , who was another acumen fund fellow , who hails from uganda , a farming community .
so , what do you think ?
i &apos;ve made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers , over the course of 300 -- 30 years , sorry , 30 years only .
the icon of icons finally has a face .
by this age the brain can actually store .
in fact we do this in individuals of any age , in these different species --
such things in the early history of babies occur in real babies .
it had a success rate of about one in eight tries .
now actually we &apos;ve looked in several different cortical areas in the monkey learning this task .
enormously different in the details from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago .
now i might say the noise problem could also occur on the basis of information provided in the world from the ears .
the brain itself can be noisy . it &apos;s commonly noisy .
what we &apos;re most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution .
and what you see are substantial improvements of their immediate memory , of their ability to remember things after a delay , of their ability to control their attention , their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities .
arunachalam muruganantham : how i started a sanitary napkin revolution !
they are not going to touch that , because it &apos;s not your matter .
armstrong . then tenzing &#91; and &#93; hillary , in everest ,
so far , 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries .
not in front pocket . i &apos;m a back pocket man .
what he was trying to do with me was to inspire me to protect the world , and show me just how fragile the world is .
the passengers who fell off the titanic fell into water of just five degrees centigrade .
we all got down onto the ice , and i then got into my swimming costume and i dived into the sea .
for those of you who don &apos;t know him , he &apos;s the great british explorer .
and i went down into my cabin and i put on my swimming costume .
well done lad ! you did it ! you did it lewis !
we &apos;ve come a long way . we &apos;re doing good .
so , that &apos;s one of the stories of oil ; there &apos;s just a lot of it .
this is 200 years of history ,
it &apos;s an abalone shell .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
so this seemed like a problem that we could do something about .
we thought we had all our bases covered , we &apos;d done everything right .
there &apos;s one way to treat jaundice , and that &apos;s what &apos;s called an exchange transfusion .
in fact that sounds kind of dumb .
so our goal is to study how they work , the resources they have access to , so that they can make this product .
these are the kinds of lessons --
failing governance in many areas : in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment , in the area of exploitation of women and children , in the area of climate change ,
they were suddenly put together by consortia of banks , of supplier agencies , of insurance agencies -- like in germany , hermes , and so on -- and they came back very , very quickly , driven by an unholy alliance between the powerful elites in the countries there and the suppliers from the north .
and this is why i &apos;m telling you this : civil society rose to the occasion .
and , again , civil societies breathing down the neck of the establishment .
this is why we have set up the governance school and the center for civil society here in berlin ,
well , for one thing , we &apos;re a youth-obsessed culture .
and he had never appeared in public since that point .
and i said , &quot; yeah . apparently i did . &quot;
she was a congresswoman when there weren &apos;t very many congresswomen .
just withering in her contempt .
his father was an sob , and , in fact , he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood , but then we were off and running .
agnes de mille is one of the great choreographers in our history .
and she began to talk about her childhood , when she was beautiful , and she literally turned -- here she was , in this broken body -- and she turned to the audience and described herself as the fair demoiselle with her red hair and her light steps and so forth , and then she said , &quot; and then puberty hit . &quot;
in fact , most of the time i don &apos;t see it .
i first saw it when i was 19 , and i immediately went out and got a poster of it , and in fact i still have that poster . 30 years later it &apos;s hanging in my house .
well , who else would be in the house ?
these paintings took a long time to make .
and we may make a story , and it satisfies us momentarily , but not really , and we come back again and again .
it &apos;s short .
&quot; i am 23 years old . it is time for me to marry and produce an heir . it is expected of me . &quot; george drained another glass of claret and turned to me .
and so i think i have to tell you just a few words , a few things about my personal life , because i think there is a connection .
i would like to show you six minutes .
lancelot imasen : but our films , they are stories that our people can relate to themselves .
and i discovered that i could be successful in life as an actor , without doing crime , without cheating nobody , without telling no lies .
werner herzog , the german filmmaker said , &quot; i need to make movies like you need oxygen . &quot;
so this is what i really think .
so imagine 45 films per week .
i &apos;m going to go right into the slides .
we even made flooring , walls and everything , out of cardboard .
now , it &apos;s hard to do . it &apos;s hard to translate a fish form , because they &apos;re so beautiful -- perfect -- into a building or object like this .
and , finally , jay dragged me to my hometown , toronto , canada .
we made it into a sailing craft .
and it was this interaction between that kind of , up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .
and they end up looking like stone .
instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 .
that big metal thing is a passage , and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom , which is on the right .
and we had the opportunity to build a building on this site .
the dome was a request from the client .
the material is lead copper , like in the building in boston .
in a very tight , small -- this is the ground level .
it &apos;s like a drug addict .
if it &apos;s going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn &apos;t show anything , and just wait .
these were the three buildings that were the ideal -- the concertgebouw , boston and berlin .
larry halprin is doing the stairs .
david byrne sings &quot; flowers &quot;
so not surprisingly , there &apos;s a lot of effort that &apos;s been done to look at alternative cooking fuels .
and conveniently , one of my students was from ghana , and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called &quot; kokonte , &quot; which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root .
there &apos;s a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those .
so when we talk about , now , the future we will create , one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in .
as : yeah , i think its large numbers of people moving it forward .
and when you feed these kids bad food , that &apos;s what they &apos;re learning . so that &apos;s really what this is all about .
the usda allows these antibiotics , these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply , and the usda paid for this ad in time magazine .
and if that &apos;s not enough , they &apos;ve gone on to say , most before they graduate high school .
everything came in plastic , in cardboard .
those are my hands . i get up at 4 a.m. every day and go cook the food for the kids , because this is what we need to do .
we have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools . and why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation , maybe two , of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food , one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a tv or computer .
we really need to change it .
the national school lunch program spends 8 billion dollars feeding 30 million children a year .
sit down and care .
there &apos;s a definite difference .
the adults behave more naturally , and the children play more readily with other children .
they were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics -- more violent , etc . -- before the surgery .
he got married . he had a son called jeremiah .
after she had surgery to remove the tumor , her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress , a pink ribbon in her hair , and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world , despite the fact that they were orthodox muslims and the mother wore a full burqa .
this is an image of ann who &apos;s had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed .
the face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin .
and the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research .
and we had an exhibit of work that followed that .
so what you don &apos;t know is , we &apos;ve got these thousands of designers working around the world , connected basically by a website , and we have a staff of three .
we just don &apos;t know how to show this . &quot; so in a way , we had taken a pre-existing need and shown solutions .
they said , this is our design , because it &apos;s not only about engaging a community ; it &apos;s about empowering a community and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process .
it &apos;s built by the parents of the kids .
quick to assemble . it &apos;s got a flap , that &apos;s the invention .
how do we improve the living standards of five billion people ?
i don &apos;t see that . i see the face of the world .
somebody said this a couple of years back .
i mean , it basically -- i haven &apos;t really thought of it .
you really reduce congestion quite substantially .
well , so we did this huge interview survey with lots of travel services , and tried to figure out who changed , and where did they go ?
behind the destruction , i found a soul of places .
13,000 girls studying here in the rooms underground , full of scorpions .
he said , &quot; bezos , i need you to go into the house . i need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
it &apos;s , &quot; how can we give credible hope to that billion people ? &quot;
before the war , america had been highly protectionist .
between them , these new revenue flows dwarf aid .
the resource curse is entirely confined to countries below a threshold of governance .
in all the societies of the bottom billion , there are intense struggles to do just that .
if you think about it , the cost of promulgating international rules is zilch -- nothing .
nobody wants an operation .
now that foundation is so important that a number of us from the largest general surgery society in the united states , sages , started in the late 1990s a training program that would assure that every surgeon who practices minimally invasive surgery would have a strong foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to go on and do procedures .
if you think about the worldwide burden of trying to talk to your patients -- not just teaching surgeons , just trying to talk to your patients -- there aren &apos;t enough translators in the world .
i need to have a health care lexicon .
allan okrainec : today we &apos;re going to practice suturing .
in fact , after college i applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven .
i found a brilliant aeronautical engineer who designs sails for america &apos;s cup racing yachts named peter heppel .
its title : &quot; 1.26 &quot; refers to the number of microseconds that the earth &apos;s day was shortened .
edward burtynsky photographs the landscape of oil
so , to me , using photography -- and i feel that all of us need to now begin to really take the task of using our talents , our ways of thinking , to begin to deal with what i think is probably one of the most challenging issues of our time , how to deal with our energy crisis .
now you &apos;ve seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms , that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains .
you will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself , all your experiences . these are some of the areas we &apos;re working on today that i don &apos;t have time to go into in detail .
and there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that i &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : there may be equivalent ways to thrive ;
well , who are we not to say this ?
so , for instance the dalai lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
so , this , i think , is what the world needs now .
and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
and biological pest control , by the way , or these good bugs that we are talking about , they &apos;ve existed in the world for thousands and thousands of years , for a long , long time .
by the way , a meal for them for 24 hours is about five individuals of the spider mites , of the bad mites , or 15 to 20 eggs of the pest mites .
but this is the end result .
and look , this flower is flooded with predatory bugs , with the good ones after wiping out the bad ones , the thrips .
on the contrary , because we bring it to every cultural plot where the balance was already disrupted by the chemicals . here we come with those natural enemies in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel and to bring more natural balance to the agricultural plot by reducing those chemicals .
if we take the overall turnover of the biocontrol industry worldwide , it &apos;s 250 million dollars .
and meanwhile , i use nonsense , as you can see .
it &apos;s the only spanish innovation , technologically , of the 20th century , by the way .
hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit , just for the fun of it . this was a piece i did -- a brochure again -- &quot; rms tyrannic : the biggest thing in all the world . &quot;
it &apos;s the little old lady that lives in a shoe , and then this thing -- the title of that was , &quot; there goes the neighborhood . &quot;
what about ourselves ?
are there any general conclusions that arise ?
one of the things that enabled australia to survive in this remote outpost of european civilization for 250 years has been their british identity .
why not eat insects ? well first , what are insects ?
they &apos;re at the start of food chains .
but there &apos;s tomatoes that end up in a soup ,
and meat , in fact , is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production .
and because of their kind of reproduction , they can combine and produce a new virus .
and even in terms of calories , it is very good .
there are a few people who don &apos;t like shrimp , but shrimp , or crabs , or crayfish , are very closely related .
over to the hague recently , she went to a high-class restaurant , and they ate insects all together .
but i am not as nervous as i was five weeks ago .
i wouldn &apos;t have my new hip for this ted .
yeah . they needed some young blood .
as technology progresses , and as it advances , many of us assume that these advances make us more intelligent , make us smarter and more connected to the world .
and the altitude corresponds to the plate system .
second , is you measure the altitude of deneb .
and what the astrolabe does is it allows us , it affords us , to connect to the night sky , to look up into the night sky and be much more -- to see the visible and the invisible together .
well , i think the first thing is that it reminds us just how resourceful people were , our forebears were , years and years ago .
and what you see over here is a very popular video game ,
the one in front , the smaller , is strider ii .
for most small wheeled robots , they use a method called differential steering where the left and right wheel turns the opposite direction .
we get so many visitors visiting our lab . so , when the visitors come , mars walks up to the computer , starts typing &quot; hello , my name is mars . &quot;
but the cool part is the user interface .
there are no tethers . it looks around , searches for the ball , looks around , searches for the ball , and it tries to play a game of soccer , autonomously : artificial intelligence .
we truly believe this is going to be the very first running humanoid robot in the united states . so , stay tuned .
but just a spark of imagination is not good enough .
this picture in the back this is 3 a.m. in the morning .
and we have environments where we have months of humidity followed by months of dryness , and that is where desertification is occurring .
when i was a young man , a young biologist in africa , i was involved in setting aside marvelous areas as future national parks .
what we had failed to understand was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world , the soil and the vegetation developed with very large numbers of grazing animals , and that these grazing animals developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators .
when i first realized that we had no option as scientists but to use much-vilified livestock to address climate change and desertification , i was faced with a real dilemma .
i began helping a family in the karoo desert in the 1970s turn the desert that you see on the right there back to grassland , and thankfully , now their grandchildren are on the land with hope for the future .
it &apos;s a little bit technical to explain here , but just that .
it &apos;s the dependence on farm subsidies and under-performing schools and higher poverty rates in rural areas than in urban .
and only eight percent of the people in the county have a bachelor &apos;s degree or higher .
but beyond our personal reasons for wanting to be there , there is a huge need .
so this game that the kids are playing here -- in this case they were learning basic multiplication through a game called match me .
it &apos;s hands-on , it &apos;s in-your-face , it requires an active engagement , and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning in real ways .
this is eric . he plays for the football team .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity .
and here &apos;s the same child three weeks post-operation , with the right eye open .
what might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones ?
the answer lies in motion and that &apos;s what i want to show you in the next clip .
the way we test dylan is by giving it inputs , as i said , of the same kind that a baby , or a child in project prakash would get .
even before the ball gets to a place , the child is already looking there .
they pick three students out of the nation every year to get involved in international affairs , and so i won a full ride to georgetown
he &apos;s coached five olympians , and the man &apos;s office is lined from floor to ceiling with all america certificates of all these athletes he &apos;s coached . he &apos;s just a rather intimidating figure .
and i went out there and made it to the big east , which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season . it was really , really hot .
i said , &quot; well , i just did it . no one told me that . &quot;
here we are , like , crème de la crème , and there is no doubt about it , that i &apos;m going to lose big .
no , these are my cosmetic legs , actually , and they &apos;re absolutely beautiful .
ss : she can &apos;t really stand on these legs . she has to be moving , so ...
and it &apos;s really an amazing store . i got them a year and two weeks ago .
rob reid : the $ 8 billion ipod
and this is just one of the many mind-blowing statistics that copyright mathematicians have to deal with every day .
governments realize that it &apos;s a big deal for our economies , but don &apos;t know how to fix it .
to function in the world today , you &apos;ve got to be pretty quantitative , much more so than a few years ago :
see , crucial point here : math is not equal to calculating .
i still do a lot of that , mainly for estimating .
a hundred years ago , it &apos;s certainly true that to drive a car you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things .
this is just nuts .
and we open up so many more possibilities .
and one of the reasons it &apos;s so important -- so it &apos;s very important to get computers in exams .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
and people are starting to wake up about that .
but if you displayed that on a crt or flat panel display , it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object , a real world object in that .
so this led full circle , in a strange way , to build these ideas into what we believe is the necessary future of human machine interface : the spatial operating environment , we call it .
here are some selection planes .
let &apos;s pull this apart :
we can &apos;t have advances in technology any longer unless design is integrated from the very start .
and i understand what you &apos;re asking .
this was the worst month of my life .
i had jewish bibles .
you know , i could spend a year not killing , but spending a year not gossiping , not coveting , not lying -- you know , i live in new york , and i work as a journalist , so this was 75 , 80 percent of my day i had to do it .
how should we view the bible ?
so , whatever you think of creationism -- and i think it &apos;s crazy -- they did a great job .
they have a pamphlet that says , &quot; here &apos;s what jesus said about homosexuality , &quot; and you open it up , and there &apos;s nothing in it .
i &apos;ve had some great meals at cafeterias .
there is more information about what &apos;s going on in kenya right now than any one person can manage .
now , that free time existed in the 20th century , but we didn &apos;t get ushahidi in the 20th century .
but media abundance never works that way .
and so the parents , quite sensibly , said , &quot; 10 shekels to pick my kid up late ?
ushahidi , by contrast , is civic value .
so i &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
either it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical s-curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
so what was the next step ?
because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
and let &apos;s reproduce them by a process of recombination analogous to sex . &quot; take two programs and they produce children by exchanging their subroutines , and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs .
the thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why i think it seems so confusing .
so , the match was ended in between .
but slowly the game moved on , you know , finally .
and then another big accident happened in our cricket .
and then the gracious people that they are , they let the world become very good at it .
the new owners of indian cricket were not the old princes .
but what this also did was it started marrying the two most important things in indian cricket , which is cricket and the movies in indian entertainment .
are they grain ?
now , this last minute before i go -- there &apos;s a couple of side effects of all this .
now , this simple equation , even for those of you who don &apos;t like equations , is something that you &apos;re quite used to .
you kind of shout out the sound , s -- and the word comes .
there &apos;s 10 tickets in this lottery .
what you knew is , you paid three dollars in the past ; 25 is outrageous .
along the way , you lost something .
they &apos;re sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them .
you &apos;ve all had this experience .
that is , they require interest rates in the hundred or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars .
people always think more is better than less : 60 is always better than 50 , and they always think now is better than later :
i tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name based on people &apos;s psychological reaction to a set of events , and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified , rather than -- not rather than , but in addition to stopping the atrocities that we &apos;re all concerned about .
i mean , this is a society that has learned -- and there are others too -- that has learned to live with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it , shall i say , as those of us who have not had many terror attacks .
my guess is that there &apos;s nothing quite that specific in our evolutionary past . but rather , if you &apos;re looking for an evolutionary explanation , you might say that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is , they &apos;re a little scared of stuff that &apos;s new and different .
adg : in persuading them .
and this is battista .
and i really struggled with this one .
so here &apos;s what it says in my explanation at the bottom left .
so that &apos;s one thing , to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics .
now this says , &quot; note to the viewer : i thought i might use a visual cliche of our time -- magritte &apos;s everyman -- to express the idea that art is mystery , continuity and history .
and if we wanted to zoom into a page , we can just open it up .
it also runs on the iphone .
the previous speaker has , i think , really painted a very good background as to the impulse behind my work and what drives me , and my sense of loss , and trying to find the answer to the big questions .
marcus : you ’ re a rapper , am i right ?
i &apos;ve not been home for quite a while , for about five years now .
amphetamines .
you know what you are ? a crocodile .
cc : mr. gelehun , i ’ d like to remind you you ’ re not on trial here for any crimes you committed .
emeka okafor : thank you , newton .
and the glass -- luckily i turned around -- i had it all in my back
and i realized when i &apos;d come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff , and people would just look at me like i &apos;d just landed from mars . but i couldn &apos;t do anything else .
i &apos;ve got 120 people
fg : that will be finished in 2003 -- september , october --
siza , on the other hand , continued in portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language .
i &apos;d seen drawings you had presented here at ted .
and his secretary , who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady , called me and said , &quot; mr. simon &apos;s sitting at his desk and the water &apos;s coming in on his head . &quot; and i told her the frank lloyd wright story .
usually i say no right away , but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned
fg : can i say something ?
and i kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture , or something of that nature , and i couldn &apos;t get away from it .
to say , &quot; wow , this is beautiful , &quot; on one level ,
and saw for the first time a third world , a view of it , that i had never actually thought was possible .
and again , it &apos;s actually a relief for what &apos;s going on in china because i think on the table right now , there &apos;s 27 nuclear power stations to be built .
so this is a pink uniform at this factory . it &apos;s a shoe factory .
there &apos;s 9,000 of them here , and they &apos;re being built for most of the big cities , beijing and shanghai , shenzhen .
in that one , there were 400 people that worked on the floor .
and they don &apos;t want to let me in .
it &apos;s referred to as &quot; e-waste &quot; there .
and it just started about 14 months ago . and the beauty of what &apos;s going on there is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that i like .
but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands .
i want to start my talk today with two observations about the human species .
because we &apos;re a smart species , we can actually create all kinds of environments that are super , super complicated , sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand , even though we &apos;ve actually created them .
you know , she &apos;s a smart , very cut creature , a primate as well , but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up .
it was useless to the monkeys at first before they realized what they could do with it .
upon entering the market -- it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets because , as the monkeys entered the door of the market , a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens so they could actually trade the tokens with one of these two guys here -- two different possible human salesmen that they could actually buy stuff from .
the other thing we also spontaneously saw , embarrassingly enough , is spontaneous evidence of larceny .
you might say , eh , that &apos;s not really irrational .
and this leads to the second bias , which economists have called loss aversion .
do the monkeys actually want to play it safe and then go with the guy who &apos;s going to do the same thing on every trial , or do they want to be risky and try to get a risky , but big , bonus , but risk the possibility of getting no bonus .
but they also do some of the irrational things we do .
when you &apos;re watching your stocks plummet into the red , when you &apos;re watching your house price go down , you &apos;re not going to be able to see that in anything but old evolutionary terms .
think back when you were just a kid .
most of what &apos;s extracted from our end-of-life stuff , if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals . to put that in perspective -- and i &apos;m using steel as a proxy here for metals , because it &apos;s the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycler , probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose .
i call this environmental arbitrage .
and because we &apos;re not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them , we &apos;re using a mining approach to extract the materials .
we blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos .
and if someone happened to be missing , we would have to , we say , &quot; fix a plate &quot; for that person , put it in the oven , then we could say grace , and we could eat .
we thought he must be out of his mind .
suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity robbing us of a sense of unity of being .
and they all spoke out of their own traditions , a word about the healing power of solidarity , one with the other . &quot;
but now , to be a good samaritan -- and i always say , and to be a good american -- for me , is not simply to congratulate myself for the individual acts of care . compassion takes on a corporate dynamic .
so i have branded myself as a war child .
luckily now things have changed
i knew it was rude , but we needed food .
don &apos;t even know the day i &apos;ll ever return .
so now i &apos;m doing music so i know what the power of music is .
as a nation we have been crippled .
she said the only way to help sudan is to invest in the women , educating them , educating the children ,
and we have not thought enough about the solutions .
he &apos;d be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice , sustainability and people &apos;s well-being .
and this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use .
they are the happiest place .
and the point really is , is that i think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening .
why is it , on the radio news every evening , i hear the ftse 100 , the dow jones , the dollar pound ratio -- i don &apos;t even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news .
how aware are you of things going on around the world , the seasons changing , people around you ?
and not only that , we need to create a great transition to get there , and we need to pave that great transition with good things .
my parents had this whole elaborate story about santa claus : how they had talked to santa claus himself and agreed that instead of santa delivering our presents over the night of christmas eve , like he did for every other family who got to open their surprises first thing christmas morning , our family would give santa more time . santa would come to our house while we were at nine o &apos;clock high mass on christmas morning , but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss . which made me very suspicious .
the virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair , sort of lounging by some water , but the libra poster is just a huge scale .
now , apparently in jerusalem in 600 bc , everyone was completely bad and evil . every single one of them : man , woman , child , infant , fetus .
women &apos;s longer lifespan ? the fact that women tend to be much less violent than men ? but , no , it wasn &apos;t any of these gifts .
&lt; transcript &gt;
i needed something that would pull me out of all this .
durga , resplendent , bedecked , beautiful , her 18 arms ready for warfare , as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy mahishasur .
it &apos;s actually almost 20 years ago when i wanted to reframe the way we use information , the way we work together : i invented the world wide web .
but then -- ok , when ted started , there was no web so things like &quot; click &quot; didn &apos;t have the same meaning .
what do you mean , &quot; data &quot; ? what &apos;s the difference -- documents , data ?
we &apos;re using them for people , we &apos;re using them for places , we &apos;re using them for your products , we &apos;re using them for events .
and if you actually go and look up berlin , you &apos;ll find that there are other blobs of data which also have stuff about berlin , and they &apos;re linked together .
we want the data .
now , they are sticking it onto -- linked data -- and now they can ask the sort of question , that you probably wouldn &apos;t ask , i wouldn &apos;t ask -- they would .
before i came down here , i looked it up on openstreetmap
ok , so it &apos;s called linked data .
then i started to think about the people in the himalayas whose cataracts would be helped , and i realized that i went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus to altruistic joy , to feeling good for the people that were being helped . i think that &apos;s a motivator .
and in a sense , i &apos;ve been reflecting on turning that part of us off .
this guy was back on his feet immediately .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
my mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
and the more candidly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
with no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
jamie drummond : let &apos;s crowdsource the world &apos;s goals
what do you want ?
this is some of the most exciting stuff in development and democracy , where citizens on the edge of a network are helping to force open the process to make sure that the big global aid promises and vague stuff up at the top really delivers for people at a grassroots level and inverts that pyramid .
i mean , it dwarfs , dwarfs everything that is actually on our news agenda , and it &apos;s invisible .
i was very glad to see goldie hawn , because i had an apology to make to her .
and i think if you start a business without financial backing , you &apos;re likely to go the wrong side of that dividing line .
but obviously , there wasn &apos;t a lot i could do about it .
rb : i know , i have -- the lawyers say you mustn &apos;t do things like that , but -- ca : i mean , speaking of which , tell us about -- rb : &quot; pammy &quot; we launched , you know -- mistakenly thought we could take on coca-cola , and we launched a cola bottle called &quot; the pammy &quot; and it was shaped a bit like pamela anderson .
but he &apos;s an absolute genius when it comes to design .
but , anyway , we managed to survive it .
rb : i was dyslexic . i had no understanding of schoolwork whatsoever .
ca : but is there a risk here ?
and he said he &apos;d be delighted . and i said -- and he said , &quot; would you like me to wear my dog collar ? &quot;
rb : capitalism has been proven to be a system that works .
but we &apos;re also trying to make them self-sustaining clinics , so that people pay for some other aspects .
alwar balasubramaniam : art of substance and absence
i think you should study in a school of art .
because of the focal length of the lens , it just shows what is on the other side .
and context , what is really context ?
i couldn &apos;t find it .
and if they say they don &apos;t get it , that &apos;s also not true , because it &apos;s in the air .
the same thing in the darkroom .
this is from the show called &quot; invisible , &quot; at talwar gallery .
i &apos;m going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow , one kind of flow of people , one kind of flow of capital , and , of course , trade in products and services .
let me share with you the results of a survey that harvard business review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people &apos;s guesses along these dimensions actually were .
so try this out with your friends and acquaintances ,
maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue .
so i developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range -- that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market that could be exported and also service our local market .
we &apos;ll start with something very simple -- newton &apos;s law : &quot; the force equals mass times acceleration . &quot; this is something that perhaps turkish airlines should have studied a bit more carefully before they ran this campaign .
luckily , with now better point-of-sale tracking , more digital media consumption , you can measure more what consumers actually do , rather than what they say they do .
the same is true of marketing .
i see you &apos;re all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy -- &quot; vielle à roue . &quot; and in spanish , &quot; zanfona . &quot;
&lt; / transcript &gt;
their car is different from every other car in the parking lot .
when i put these people in the machine , before i put them in the mri machine , i would ask them all kinds of questions .
they have songs , poems , novels , sculptures , paintings , myths , legends .
and , indeed , that caravan is moving on .
one of them is women &apos;s verbal ability . women can talk .
when the -- and there &apos;s also many more male idiots in the world .
they &apos;re now saying that in america , that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85 . because in that highest age category of 76 to 85 , as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them .
so i want to conclude with two things . i want to conclude with a worry -- i have a worry -- and with a wonderful story .
they said , &quot; yes . &quot;
an hour later they get down off of the rickshaw , and she throws her hands up and she says , &quot; wasn &apos;t that wonderful ? &quot;
this is 59 seconds into the film .
interestingly , the nurses themselves , sort of , snapped into action -- said , ok , we embrace this . what can we do ?
we were asked by a device producer -- we did the palm pilot and the treo .
why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle ?
but big selling bookcase . how do we replicate this for children ?
we had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world .
how far you can anticipate , what follows from it , what are the threats , what are the possibilities , the challenges , the opportunities ?
and there are some of those qualities in this drawing , which seeks to sum up the recommendations .
for example , if you take , and you make a comparison between a recent kind of city , what i &apos;ll call , simplistically , a north american city -- and detroit is not a bad example , it is very car dependent .
and here , the first thing you can see is that this building , the roof is a very warm kind of overcoat blanket , a kind of insulating garden , which is also about the celebration of public space .
the library of the free university , which opened last year , is an example of that .
and the turning point was probably , in our terms , when we had the first computer .
a combination of biomass , aquifers , burning vegetable oil -- a process that , quite interestingly , was developed in eastern germany , at the time of its dependence on the soviet bloc .
and the base of the building is again about public space .
hubert was saying , absolutely correctly , &quot; these are the new cathedrals . &quot;
so , in the next eight minutes i would like to share with you my story .
as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over 2,000 schools in india , riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in india in math , english and science .
so , you &apos;re getting the pattern . first 200 children at riverside .
kbs : girls and boys in hyderabad , going out , pretty difficult , but they did it .
anil gupta is on the hunt for the developing world &apos;s unsung inventors -- indigenous entrepreneurs whose ingenuity , hidden by poverty , could change many people &apos;s lives . he shows how the honey bee network helps them build the connections they need -- and gain the recognition they deserve .
so what kind of a contributor was i ?
it must be the same .
the rice that you ate in the lunch , and you will eat today , is transplanted by women bending in a very awkward posture ,
and it all begins with curiosity .
obviously she &apos;s an artist ; she &apos;s a creative person .
and a new business model can emerge .
higher the local fit , greater is the chance of scaling up .
new inventions are the passion of my life .
this innovation is from the slums of rio .
now , this lady , she used to do the winding of the yarn for pochampally saree .
and i think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk -- that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being without proper darkness .
and it &apos;s just a bit bright up there , so these people have found a very intriguing solution .
and i see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax and to contemplate .
and it is all about this planet .
so i asked our laboratory to do something about it , and they said , &quot; well , we can do something . &quot;
and can we preserve the darkness ?
and finally i want to point out that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater .
and henry ford , just about 100 years ago , started cranking out model ts .
and i certainly wouldn &apos;t want to give up my airplane , or my helicopter , or my humvee , or my porsche .
in 5,000 years , we &apos;ve gone backwards in getting around cities .
one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted , happened out here in california .
cars were not meant for parallel parking ; they &apos;re wonderful machines to go between cities , but just think about it : we &apos;ve solved all the long-range , high-speed problems .
depending on whose numbers you believe , it &apos;s between 60 and 85,000 people per day .
we have to plan issues many months in advance ; we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months , nine months down the road . so we &apos;re in the forecasting business .
the first is the critical price .
there &apos;s a company called apex , a no-name chinese firm , who has , several times in the past year , been the number-one dvd seller in america . their average price , for last year , was 48 dollars .
if you look here , here &apos;s linux in red , and it &apos;s hit 20 percent . interestingly , it &apos;s done a crossover before , but not the crossovers that matter .
it &apos;s an economic force ; it &apos;s a technical force .
&lt; transcript &gt;
even more problematic , they &apos;re not listening to poor people themselves .
and it could transform swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green .
we &apos;re starting to see these happening all around the world .
educational initiatives like dil and the citizen foundation that are building schools across the country .
and he said , &quot; of course i will .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
during the hurricane , you had msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog , updating it frequently . this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools .
i like music , and i like banjos , and i think i probably heard steve martin playing ,
but anyways .
and today he is a healthy baby , who , if you read his blog -- it &apos;s snowdeal.org , his father &apos;s blog -- he is taking pictures of him still , because he is still his son and he is , i think , at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital .
so , that has always influenced me .
i was sick , and i was in a hotel room , and i wanted not to be there . and so you see these things .
i &apos;ve been fascinated for a lifetime by the beauty , form and function of giant bluefin tuna .
the result is whether you &apos;re looking at the west or the eastern bluefin population , there &apos;s been tremendous decline on both sides , as much as 90 percent if you go back with your baseline to 1950 .
and for the first time , we &apos;re able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean using light and photons to measure sunrise and sunset .
so in a program called tag-a-giant we &apos;ve actually gone from ireland to canada , from corsica to spain .
there are two villages , harris and morehead city , every winter for over a decade , held a party called tag-a-giant , and together , fishers worked with us to tag 800 to 900 fish .
this model , a model of overlap , is the way to move forward .
and now , together , what we can see on this ocean of color that &apos;s temperature , we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks .
they &apos;re taking information from our planet at very critical places like antarctica and the poles .
we can save the white shark .
&quot; where were you the 11th ? &quot; &quot; where were you the 10th ? &quot; &quot; where were you the 29th ? the 30th ? &quot; &quot; where were you october 5th ? &quot; we read about six months of my calendar .
so at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs , they said , &quot; hey , everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
so you can see , delta 1252 going from kansas city to atlanta .
sometimes there &apos;s a lot of information .
at 11 : 39 a.m. was this one .
but if 300 million people in the u.s. started doing this , we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up .
and i &apos;m glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields .
what &apos;s changed is we now can look at the evidence , we can compare societies , more and less equal societies , and see what inequality does .
now i &apos;m going to show you what that does to our societies .
here , for instance , is trust .
there &apos;s a about a tenfold difference there , log scale up the side .
so what we &apos;re looking at is general social disfunction related to inequality .
you see there that sweden does better than britain all the way across the social hierarchy .
there are 200 studies of health in relation to income and equality in the academic peer-reviewed journals .
he had a vision . when he got out , he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight , and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision .
you want a dirty magazine ?
and i haven &apos;t the slightest idea of what it does or what it &apos;s good for , but i want it .
yeah ! yeah .
so , imagine i have a plank about two feet wide and 30 feet long
so to get work done , you &apos;ve got to set a deadline , right ?
most of what we do is subconscious .
and the third level is reflective , which is , if you like the superego , it &apos;s a little part of the brain that has no control over what you do , no control over the -- doesn &apos;t see the senses , doesn &apos;t control the muscles .
i &apos;m only saying positive things from now on .
that seemed a little damning , and i tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure , or with the availability of electricity , and things like that .
so , you know , it puts the teacher into a tough bind , you have to think .
very quickly , he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad something moves on the screen -- and later on he told me , &quot; i have never seen a television where you can do something . &quot;
so they said , &quot; well , you &apos;ve left this machine which talks only in english , so we had to learn english . &quot;
but we got a clean learning curve , almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school .
and asked them -- i gave them about 68 different values-oriented questions and simply asked them their opinions .
i think it &apos;s time that the educationists made their own specs , and i have such a set of specs . this is a brief look at that .
and i did the tests in the royal air force to become a pilot , and sure enough , i failed .
and that was exciting -- that was fun .
it was nice .
but , in a way , i &apos;ve got used to the sensation of it .
there was this whole fancy diplomatic system , this negotiation process about the future of kosovo , and the kosovars weren &apos;t part of it .
we &apos;re advising various island states in the climate change negotiations , which is suppose to culminate in copenhagen .
they may be corporations , they may be mafiosi , they may be nice ngos , they may anything , any number of things .
this is terrible that you don &apos;t consult these people who are actually affected .
that is the politics of the 21st century ,
the real bacteria and viruses are so small we can &apos;t see them without a microscope , and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick .
instead , it silently slips into the bacteria &apos;s own dna , and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell , waiting for instructions .
if we want to summarize that story that i told you earlier , we could start by saying something like , &quot; these viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their dna into a bacterium . &quot;
but just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across .
lauren zalaznick : the conscience of television
as humans , what &apos;s important to remember is that we &apos;ve developed , we &apos;ve evolved over time to temper , or tame , these basic animal instincts .
so i really hope our global audiences can relate .
social commentary is all of a sudden spiking up .
this is a quick chart . here &apos;s another attribute : fantasy and imagination , which are shows defined as , &quot; takes me out of my everyday realm &quot; and &quot; makes me feel better . &quot;
what do people want in their tv then ?
jonathan haidt : religion , evolution , and the ecstasy of self-transcendence
stephen bradley : i thought i saw the savior in human shape for about one second in the room , with arms extended , appearing to say to me , &quot; come . &quot;
i believe that it is nothing less than the assurance of immortality that makes self-sacrifice at these moments so relatively easy .
so here &apos;s the million-dollar question for social scientists like me : is the staircase a feature of our evolutionary design ?
and once you put these guys in a boat competing with another boat , now they &apos;ve got no choice but to cooperate because they &apos;re all in the same boat .
and now let &apos;s rerun the simulation putting one of these superorganisms into a population of free-riders , of defectors , of cheaters and look what happens .
one of the most common is climbing the secret staircase and losing ourselves .
i see this desire in my students at the university of virginia .
as i was building this space , i thought to myself , &quot; surely i &apos;m not the only guy to have to have carved out a space for his own . &quot;
this is in long island , new york .
and so they created these spaces to reflect what they love to do , and who they were .
take a look at the second door and see if there &apos;s any different message .
so , this is from &quot; 2nd sight , &quot; a book i did on intuition .
so , a couple spreads from the book : here mcluhan says , &quot; the new media are not bridges between man and nature ; they are nature . &quot;
got no way of tracking it , so i could be totally wrong .
you know : thank god it &apos;s monday -- i get to go back to that little cubicle , those fake gray walls , and hear everybody else &apos;s conversations f or 10 hours and then go home .
and i was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we &apos;d already seen a million times , which was basically the moment of impact .
i &apos;m not sure this is an improvement , or a good idea , because , like , if you don &apos;t spend quite enough time in front of your computer , you can now get a plate in the keyboard , so there &apos;s no more faking it -- that you don &apos;t really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway . now there &apos;s a plate , and it would be really , really convenient to get a piece of pizza , then type a little bit , then ...
why not experiment ? why not have some fun ?
before that , obviously , technology didn &apos;t exist . but obviously it did .
craig venter &apos;s tremendous and brilliant attempt to dna sequence things in the ocean is great .
and wherever life is , it never retreats . it &apos;s ubiquitous and it wants to be more .
and thirdly , the idea that machines are becoming biological and complex is at this point a cliche . and i &apos;m happy to say , i was partly responsible for that cliche that machines are becoming biological , but that &apos;s pretty evident .
all of them are still being produced . so you &apos;ve got corn shellers .
the origins of technology was not in 1829 , but was actually at the beginning of the big bang , and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe were compressed . the entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot , and it was so tight in there , there was no room for any difference at all .
that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
and i reached down and picked him up , and immediately became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility .
then he lifts another arm and i lift an arm .
and after the first week , they ignored us .
and as you go deeper , that lovely , blue water you were launched in gives way to darker and darker blue .
and it completely threw science on its head .
so this rainwater is flooding down the hillside , carrying with it sediments from the construction site , smothering the coral and killing it .
and fix it .
&lt; transcript &gt;
and the primary policemen are women , because we are the carriers of the tradition .
and then i thought -- in my 40s i started thinking , &quot; well , why don &apos;t i do something ?
and the tsunami of problems that we feel we &apos;re facing in terms of sustainability questions are actually a reflection of the exponential increase in urbanization across the planet .
so here &apos;s two questions that i have in my head when i think about this problem .
that &apos;s called growth . here &apos;s how you grew .
it &apos;s particularly astonishing because each one of these organisms , each subsystem , each cell type , each gene , has evolved in its own unique environmental niche with its own unique history .
is new york a scaled up san francisco , which is a scaled up santa fe ?
here it is , which says that the bigger you are the more you have per capita , unlike biology -- higher wages , more super-creative people per capita as you get bigger , more patents per capita , more crime per capita .
on the left is the heart rate showing biology .
this happens to be income and assets versus the size of the company as denoted by its number of employees .
in 1931 , my grandmother -- bottom left for you guys over here -- graduated from the eighth grade .
and i believed it ,
but they were into it . and i asked them to put their own voice over it .
and the student that persistently turns out the best visual product did not disappoint .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
regenerative medicine is what business week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago .
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease .
this video , i think , gets across the concept that i &apos;m talking about quite dramatically .
and there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today .
this is an older lady . she has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes , and has decided to die with what &apos; s left of her body intact .
you can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish .
this is the same procedure , but now done minimally invasively , with only three holes in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure .
the gun that you see there sprays cells .
but there &apos;s been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .
how do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity ?
not only , of course , the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities .
you know , when you &apos;re standing up here , you can see all the different people .
my name is noraida . and i &apos;m just -- i &apos;m so thrilled to be part of like your ted conference that you &apos;re doing and everything like that .
you know , like you guys , you would really like it and everything .
and it was madame bousson , you know , she was very &#91; french &#93; .
and , sadly , i don &apos;t think we &apos;ll have time for you to meet everybody i brought , but -- i &apos;m trying to behave myself ,
she only wants to spend time with her friends .
it is not harvard .
i just -- thank you .
so , when these kind of people -- and , believe me , it &apos;s not just the police that use these taxis in lagos . we all do . i &apos;ve been on one of these , and i didn &apos;t have a helmet , either .
it &apos;s been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the u.k .
i got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the u.k .
the oxygen tanks didn &apos;t quite work right .
decide which instruments , stock it up with consumables . and currently we &apos;re working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site .
but i found that there were some advantages to being in hollywood .
i then had a bit of a wake-up call when i was 14 .
bet on good people doing good things . &quot;
and i thought about the films that inspired me , films like &quot; gandhi &quot; and &quot; schindler &apos;s list . &quot;
speaking of which , our fellow tedster , al -- i first saw al do his slide show presentation on global warming in may of 2005 .
and a documentary that we &apos;re doing on jimmy carter and his mid-east peace efforts over the years .
the next day , all the artists were invited to join mandela in robben island , where he was going to give a conference to the world &apos;s press , standing in front of his former prison cell .
it &apos;s quite extraordinary what they do .
now that is prevention at the very beginning of life .
i think that &apos;s fair to say , it &apos;s almost everyone in the hall .
in a pre-internet world , sovereignty over our physical freedoms , or lack thereof , was controlled almost entirely by nation-states .
this is a map of social networks worldwide , and certainly facebook has conquered much of the world -- which is either a good or a bad thing , depending on how you like the way facebook manages its service .
we don &apos;t necessarily always do it very well , but we have a sense of what the models are , politically and institutionally , to do that .
these are grim economic times , fellow tedsters , grim economic times indeed .
and amongst the chaos , amidst the euphoria , it took me a little while to understand that some of the people who had wielded power before 1989 , in eastern europe , continued to do so after the revolutions there .
and so i resolved to travel around the world examining this global criminal underworld by talking to policemen , by talking to victims , by talking to consumers of illicit goods and services .
the congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia in exchange for weapons ,
and boy , did that make it easy for the money launderers .
there has , however , been no concomitant increase in the resources available to police forces .
and it &apos;s actually much easier because the fascinating thing about cybercrime is that it &apos;s not so much the technology .
there is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st century .
i quickly made an arrangement with a red cross relief worker , who used his official van to transport the money to lungi airport , freetown , although he did not know the real contents of the box .
ze frank : oh . amazing .
voice : we want malcolm gladwell .
i won &apos;t -- hold on . making things , you know --
i mean this is incredible . this is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this
and all over the world , eminent evolutionists are anxious to celebrate this .
the paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely at the accompanying microfauna that lived in the same time and place as the hominids .
that &apos;s why you don &apos;t hear them talking about it . it &apos;s yesterday &apos;s question .
peals of merry laughter !
we have got skin lined with this layer .
i ask people sometimes , and they say , &quot; i like the aquatic theory !
hardy &apos;s ideas and darwin &apos;s ideas will be blended together .
and secondly , he says , &quot; you must never be afraid to rock the boat . &quot;
and so i was thinking about how it might be great if i could just take all these noises -- like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head -- if i could just physically extricate them and pull them out in such a form that i could share them with somebody else .
and so when i was first living in new york city a few years back , i was thinking a lot about the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me and how i would like to better relate to them .
and i was really struck by how much it affected me .
the second one -- unlike most animals , which is survival of the species -- this is preservation of self .
second of all , i &apos;m going to recommend that you get into a proactive stance and write to your elected officials at least once a month .
because this establishes the two primary criteria for the political creature : that you have influence in a large sphere , and that my preservation depends on you .
this is where we &apos;re headed in terms of global temperature rises , and if we keep on going the way we &apos;re going , we get a four- or five-degree-centigrade temperature rise by the end of this century .
what &apos;s wrong with you people on the other side in the other party ?
we love to circle around things . we circle around flags , and then we can trust each other .
and what they do on that survey is they ask what &apos;s called a feeling thermometer rating .
so open primaries would make that problem much , much less severe .
so here &apos;s another asteroid .
they earn a lot of money , they invest that money in their kids , some of them become tiger mothers , the kids rise to their full potential , and the kids go on to become the top two lines in this graph .
for example , the incarceration rate , the prison population in this country has quadrupled since 1980 .
and this is the conversion of one group of substances into another , either through the production or the absorption of energy .
and that &apos;s the shell around that globular fat .
we &apos;re looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this .
sebastian thrun helped build google &apos;s amazing driverless car , powered by a very personal quest to save lives and reduce traffic accidents . jawdropping video shows the darpa challenge-winning car motoring through busy city traffic with no one behind the wheel , and dramatic test drive footage from ted2011 demonstrates how fast the thing can really go .
mountain roads , day and night , and even crooked lombard street in san francisco .
on this map , the colored areas represent water conflicts .
it &apos;s a broken system . there &apos;s a disincentive to conserve , because , if you don &apos;t use your water right , you can lose your water right .
you &apos;ve got a disincentive to conserve , because if you don &apos;t use your water right , you risk losing your water right .
we &apos;ve returned more than four billion gallons of water to degraded ecosystems .
compassion is fun .
and let me give you some examples .
so what has this got to do with business leadership ?
that &apos;s one .
the third step , following the second step , is to create new mental habits .
we often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
and when i walked up to the prison director , i said , &quot; you &apos;ve got to let her out .
but the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be .
and at moma we put out some books just for people to suggest their own humble masterpieces .
design can be that , of course , but it can also be this .
and at the same time , the gorgeous work of takeshi ishiguro , who did these beautiful salt-and-pepper containers that are made of rice dough .
so , designers do need to be mavericks ,
i don &apos;t think it ever happened before at moma ;
sometimes hammer-on .
and this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin ,
a typical disaster story : disease , corruption , poverty . and some of you might be standing here thinking , saying , &quot; ok , you know , ory , you &apos;re harvard-educated , and all you privileged people come here , saying , &apos; forget the poor people . let &apos;s focus on business and the markets , and whatever . &apos; &quot;
and my father said , &quot; ok , listen . let &apos;s go and try and talk to the headmistress .
and that kept him going .
so we need to start getting better .
one is because i &apos;m pretty aggressive , and i try and find , you know , opportunities .
myshkin ingawale : a blood test without bleeding
what was really shocking for me was that he said that this is entirely due to undiagnosed anemia .
she is really the center of the health care system .
one of the things which my intern here , pratesh , built is a mobile application , which can now send all this data anywhere it wants to go .
none of the glamour that you see today existed .
the average growth of our economy is about 15 percent for the past five years .
this is the best technology that this region could ever have : desalination .
so we know very well -- i showed you earlier -- that we need this energy .
i woke up the morning after i gave that talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life .
the first is vulnerability is not weakness .
about three months ago , i was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store .
we heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery , which is have a checklist .
but when he &apos;s in the arena , at best he wins , and at worst he loses , but when he fails , when he loses , he does so daring greatly . &quot;
it &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
shame is an epidemic in our culture .
it is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird .
so if you go down , you have the large area of propulsion ,
woman : everywhere i went looking for work , they said no , what use do we have for a blind woman ?
when we grow in spiritual consciousness , we identify ourselves with all that is in the world , so there is no exploitation .
we did a study , a scientifically designed process , and then , to our dismay , we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need , and we &apos;re not adequately addressing more , bigger problems .
so the final part of the puzzle is , how do you make all this work financially , especially when the people can &apos;t pay for it ?
maybe there is -- the solution to the cost could be in productivity , maybe in efficiency , in the clinical process , or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables , or regulations , their defensive practice .
that &apos;s my question .
again , it &apos;s a mobile phone-shaped box ,
very exciting .
a part of me had become alienated from myself .
because of what i &apos;m about to say , i really should establish my green credentials .
the aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming :
social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense .
it &apos;s not supposed to be there , but it &apos;s huge .
so the event is : we &apos;re a city planet . that just happened .
and there &apos;s not enough carrying capacity to support the people . and then you &apos;re in trouble .
it &apos;s supposed to be , i don &apos;t know , local solar and wind and cogeneration , and good things like that .
they reduce pesticide use .
that would be considered an act of war by both nations .
this is the boat we were on , by the way .
on the question of , &quot; what if the ipc scientists are all wrong ? &quot;
now this is actually a popular plaque , and this is a crowd of overachievers , so i &apos;m betting that some of you have this plaque .
in other words , the ocean is big ; she can take it .
and most controversially , it means the tar sands .
now , you may have noticed more and more headlines like these .
barry friedman : there are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today , but this is really , i think , when it reached its peak as far as ergonomics , comfort , design , flexibility ... dh : now obviously , this is not something we do on our regular show ;
bf : ok . dh : oh ! all right .
richard wurman : can i say something ?
dh : one more , one more .
bf : this guy , this guy invented air .
dh : and turn up the intensity ; we &apos;re still pink in the middle .
and believe it or not , you don &apos;t win juggling champions for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups .
dh : wow ! what a great trick , barry !
dh : ... to back .
so i &apos;m thinking , you know , this procedure hasn &apos;t changed in about 40 years .
adult stem cells are throughout our body , including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow ,
so it &apos;s really quite big .
so a woman is age 37 .
so on top of l-dopa , they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug , and they &apos;re effectively normal now .
this is a typewriter , a staple of every desktop for decades .
and it looks really good .
&lt; / transcript &gt;
that , by the laws of quantum mechanics , branches into a state in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not .
any particles more massive than this energy limit aren &apos;t produced , and remain invisible to us .
now , if we count up all these different particles using their various spins and charges , there are 226 .
nature always keeps a perfect balance .
this is the way theories of unification work .
this e8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots .
now , the only way to maintain sanity and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty is to keep balance and perspective in life .
and that shape has remarkable similarities -- and the way it fits into this e8 pattern could be the rest of the picture .
so i &apos;ll be talking about the success of my campus , the university of maryland , baltimore county , umbc , in educating students of all types , across the arts and humanities and the science and engineering areas . what makes our story especially important is that we have learned so much from a group of students who are typically not at the top of the academic ladder -- students of color , students underrepresented in selected areas .
i wanted to know that the school i attended not only had good teachers , but the resources we needed .
and the question is this : how is it that now we lead the country in producing african-americans who go on to complete ph.d. &apos; s in science and engineering and m.d. / ph.d. &apos; s ?
i don &apos;t care how smart you are or how smart you think you are .
students are not taught to work in groups .
and so we redesigned chemistry , we redesigned physics .
jane goodall helps humans and animals live together
and we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees , just as it is for us , in relation to learning .
this led to a program , which we call tacare .
and the other problems -- in not only africa , but the rest of the developing world and , indeed , everywhere --
and the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support , who are too poor to buy food , who can &apos;t move away because the whole land is degraded .
and then , if they &apos;re able , they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world .
it &apos;s one of my hobbyhorses .
we could make a very long list , but obviously nelson mandela , emerging from 17 years of hard physical labor , 23 years of imprisonment , with this amazing ability to forgive , so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath .
so we don &apos;t really have easy access to all this relevant information that can just help us make optimal decisions about what to do next and what actions to take .
and , as he picks up a product the system can recognize the product that he &apos;s picking up , using either image recognition or marker technology , and give him the green light or an orange light .
thank you .
all of my beverages are packaged in plastic , even at the health food market .

then , a few months later , hurricane katrina slammed into the side of america .
and this is from my pond .
there you go chris .
and where do people live ? near water .
and yet , it feels natural to us now .
i was married when i was 14 .
but she reached out to us in that way ,
those who are interested in poetry , the poem is &quot; a shropshire lad &quot; written by a.e. housman .
now that suits the powerful up to a moment .
so there &apos;s my first message , that if you are to pass through these turbulent times more or less turbulently , then our success in doing that will in large measure depend on our capacity to bring sensible governance to the global space .
now notice , in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world , you have fixed alliances -- nato , the warsaw pact .
how many americans ? 11 .
now the enemy is inside the walls .
and so suddenly , ladies and gentlemen , what has been the proposition of visionaries and poets down the ages becomes something we have to take seriously as a matter of public policy .
and does purpose play into it ?
there is just too many things to go wrong .
they came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat , a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals so the cheese is high in omega-3 fatty acids instead of omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals , and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world .
and they eat about eight times as much tofu as americans do .
instead there is one word that imbues your entire life , and that word is &quot; ikigai . &quot;
and the difference is even more pronounced among men , who are expected to live about 11 years longer than their american counterparts .

we know from the framingham studies , that if your three best friends are obese there is a 50 percent better chance that you &apos;ll be overweight .
it took us 11 years to become operational .
and after that first parabola , you know , the doc said everything is great . he was smiling , and we said go .
and what i &apos;ve tried to do since i had my training as a medical illustrator -- since i was taught animation by my father , who was a sculptor and my visual mentor -- i wanted to figure out a way to help people understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences by using animation , by using pictures , by telling stories
they pass information to each other . they cause different things to happen inside the cell .
his death hit me pretty hard .
and when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night , i used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet .
and when i realized that tim russert , former moderator of &quot; meet the press , &quot; was talking about my writing , while i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot , i started laughing .
three years ago i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot ,
we didn &apos;t take no as an answer ; we took no as a question .
so we went to the teachers .
and this is on the fourth of july .
so i thought , &quot; well , if you can &apos;t go to the government , go to the military . &quot;
these are primary school kids -- third , fourth grade -- going to every household in the village , every household in the whole of thailand , giving aids information and a condom to every household , given by these young kids .
i gave this to al gore and to bill senior also .
so , that was done .
and then now , finally in education , we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it &apos;s a lifelong learning center for everyone .
he should be friendly and cute .
i &apos;ve always wanted a picture of a 1,500-person ted audience .

the streets of turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the olympics .
at some point around midnight , we were summoned to the wings of the stadium , and the loudspeakers announced the olympic flag , and the music started -- by the way , the same music that starts here , the aida march .
somehow , the family survives for 16 months , and then , by extraordinary luck , and the passionate heart of a young american man , sasha chanoff , who manages to put her in a u.s. rescue plane ,

they are the poorest of the poor .
in january i saw an exhibit of fernando botero &apos;s paintings at the uc berkeley library .
thank you .
just like in language and other domains , we know that it &apos;s hard for people to parse very complex sentences with a kind of recursive structure .
where are these things happening in the brain ?
if they can do it in 10 seconds , they &apos;re going to actually earn that money .
your intuition might tell you that too .
they &apos;re still our closest genetic kin .
his thought was , maybe they &apos;ve preserved brain activities and they practice them in development that are really , really important to them to negotiate status and to win , which is something like strategic thinking during competition .
here &apos;s two human groups in green and blue .
and given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it &apos;s passed through an animal first , that &apos;s not a very efficient way of feeding us .
in the ancient near east , known as the fertile crescent .
if we look at a map of london in the 17th century , we can see that its grain , which is coming in from the thames , along the bottom of this map .
and if we look at an image of smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from .
we used to cook ; now we just add water , or a little bit of an egg if you &apos;re making a cake or something .
because it &apos;s an ideal . it &apos;s an imaginary thing . we can &apos;t have it .
and this is a community project i visited recently in toronto .
we know we are what we eat .
enabling me to speak to a much , much wider audience than i could have ever conceived .
and i want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking .
and we learn amity .
so , whenever given an opportunity , i try to do something in it or with it or for it .
and here &apos;s a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page .
over the spanish steps we go .
at the end of lunch , they untie the anchor , they set off through the baths of caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse
but he &apos;s not happy ; something &apos;s wrong .
there &apos;s a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together .
no foldouts , no tricks -- just a book that isn &apos;t open the whole way .
he lives in this little garret --
this is one of those things i show to my students because it &apos;s a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective .
mit researcher skylar tibbits works on self-assembly -- the idea that instead of building something , we can create materials that build themselves , much the way a strand of dna zips itself together . it &apos;s a big concept at early stages ; tibbits shows us three in-the-lab projects that hint at what a self-assembling future might look like .
the first two are the macrobot and decibot .
so they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed .
so i think these projects i &apos;ve showed here are just a tiny step towards this future , if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world .
he came up with a name for his mystery agent .
at first we thought that perhaps this was artifact .
nowadays this idea has a dramatic name : spaceship earth .
that &apos;s how big and how dark the universe is .
so we are a chemical scum that is different . this chemical scum has universality .
and locally there you could build particle accelerators , and learn elementary particle physics , and chemistry , and so on .
because if it &apos;s true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co2 emissions with something like the kyoto protocol , with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is , then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure .
craig venter on dna and the sea
for example , it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments .
synthetic dna , the ability to synthesize dna , has changed at sort of the same pace that dna sequencing has over the last decade or two , and is getting very rapid and very cheap .
basically , any virus that &apos;s been sequenced today -- that genome can be made .
so we know lots of different pathways , thousands of different organisms now that live off of co2 , and can capture that back .

and nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights .
we &apos;ve got to find ways to build up , as well .
so after the four special zones , there were 14 coastal cites that were open in the same sense ,
we also need the choices for people .
let us have a hong kong nearby .
we &apos;d go from three percent of the arable land , to four percent .
let me conclude with this picture .
of teenage girls who pledged sexual abstinence and virginity until marriage -- thank you george bush -- the majority , 60 percent , yielded to sexual temptations within one year .
because their focus is what is now .
what you get from the present hedonism is the energy , the energy to explore yourself , places , people , sensuality .
and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this , there &apos;s saturn . and we have been to saturn before -- we visited saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the cassini spacecraft , traveling across interplanetary space for seven years , glided into orbit around saturn in the summer of 2004 , and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the sun .
it &apos;s a condensable in the atmosphere , and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities . you can have methane clouds , ok , and above those clouds , you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze , which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface .
but we couldn &apos;t make sense of our images , until , six months after we got into orbit , an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of cassini &apos;s investigation of titan .
so , this is the picture you would have at the window of titanian airlines as you fly across the surface of titan .
just to show you the size . this is not meant to be a threat .
but as if that weren &apos;t brilliant enough , we can spot , in this beautiful image , sight of our own planet , cradled in the arms of saturn &apos;s rings .
but the top story of this past year was the economy ,
but my pick for the top long news story of this past year was this one : water found on the moon .
and this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere .
about seven years ago , they faced extinction , because israel announced it would build a separation barrier , and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village . they would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded , so they would lose free access to the rest of the west bank .
protester : this is a peaceful march .
so we organized a screening .
and yet , they &apos;re just a computer company .
and by &quot; why &quot; i don &apos;t mean &quot; to make a profit . &quot;
here &apos;s our new car :
and they can make perfectly well-designed products --
because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn &apos;t control language .
then how come we &apos;ve never heard of samuel pierpont langley ?
but why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe ?
it &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
we don &apos;t need it . we don &apos;t like it .
it &apos;s what they believed about america that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in washington in the middle of august .
so we &apos;ll start with the hippocampus , shown in yellow , which is the organ of memory .
and indeed , on the inputs to the hippocampus , cells are found which project into the hippocampus , which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it &apos;s exploring around .
so we can put people in an mri scanner and have them do a little video game like the one i showed you and look for this signal .
this is verdun , a battlefield in france just north of the nato headquarters in belgium .
this is an attack on the global commons .
this is where al qaeda is staged from .
now , we are also teaching them combat skills , of course , but i would argue , open-source security means connecting in ways that create longer lasting security effect .
why do we want to get in these nets ?
it &apos;s a perfect image for the fundamental point that no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together .
