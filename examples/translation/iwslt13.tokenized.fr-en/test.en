you know , one of the intense plea@@ sures of travel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ graphi@@ c research is the opportunity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ gotten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , touch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by rain , taste it in the bit@@ ter leaves of plants .
just to know that j@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still journey beyond the mil@@ ky way , or the my@@ ths of the in@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with meaning , or that in the him@@ al@@ ay@@ a , the bu@@ ddhis@@ ts still pur@@ sue the breath of the d@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ logy , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not exist in some absolute sense , but is just one model of reality , the conse@@ quence of one particular set of adap@@ tive choices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it success@@ fully , many generations ago .
and of course , we all share the same adap@@ tive im@@ per@@ atives .
we &apos;re all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we go through initi@@ ation r@@ ites .
we have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it shouldn &apos;t surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what &apos;s interesting is the unique ca@@ dence of the song , the rhy@@ th@@ m of the dance in every culture .
and whether it is the pen@@ an in the for@@ ests of bor@@ ne@@ o , or the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in hai@@ ti , or the w@@ arri@@ ors in the k@@ ai@@ su@@ t desert of northern kenya , the cur@@ ander@@ o in the mountains of the an@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ ans@@ erai in the middle of the sahar@@ a -- this is inci@@ dent@@ ally the fellow that i trav@@ eled into the desert with a month ago -- or indeed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ pes of q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , ever@@ est , the go@@ dd@@ ess mother of the world .
all of these peop@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of orient@@ ing yourself in the earth .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world make up a web of spiritu@@ al life and cultural life that envelop@@ s the planet , and is as important to the well-@@ being of the planet as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a bio@@ sphere .
and you might think of this cultural web of life as being an eth@@ no@@ sphere , and you might define the eth@@ no@@ sphere as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspir@@ ations , intu@@ i@@ tions brought into being by the human imagination since the d@@ a@@ wn of consciousness .
the eth@@ no@@ sphere is humanity &apos;s great leg@@ acy .
it &apos;s the symbo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an aston@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ is@@ itive species .
and just as the bio@@ sphere has been sever@@ ely ero@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ no@@ sphere -- and , if anything , at a far greater rate .
no biolog@@ ists , for example , would d@@ are suggest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of extinction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most apo@@ cal@@ yp@@ tic scen@@ ario in the re@@ al@@ m of biological diversity -- scar@@ cel@@ y appro@@ aches what we know to be the most optimis@@ tic scen@@ ario in the re@@ al@@ m of cultural diversity .
and the great indi@@ cat@@ or of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 languages spo@@ ken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of vo@@ ca@@ bu@@ lar@@ y or a set of gram@@ mati@@ cal rules .
a language is a fl@@ ash of the human spirit .
it &apos;s a vehicle through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a water@@ shed , a thought , an ecosystem of spiritu@@ al possibilities .
and of those 6@@ ,000 languages , as we sit here today in monter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ears of children .
they &apos;re no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
what could be more lon@@ ely than to be envelop@@ ed in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancest@@ ors or antici@@ p@@ ate the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is indeed the pli@@ ght of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the grave the last sy@@ ll@@ ables of an ancient ton@@ gue .
and i know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spoke one language ? &quot; and i say , &quot; great , let &apos;s make that language yor@@ u@@ ba . let &apos;s make it c@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
let &apos;s make it ko@@ g@@ i . &quot;
and you &apos;ll suddenly discover what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
and so , what i &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , a bri@@ ef journey through the eth@@ no@@ sphere , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; i really do mean different ways of being .
take , for example , this child of a bar@@ as@@ ana in the nor@@ th@@ west amaz@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ tho@@ log@@ ically they came up the milk river from the east in the bel@@ ly of sac@@ red s@@ na@@ kes .
now , this is a people who cogni@@ tively do not distin@@ gu@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the canop@@ y of the heav@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the canop@@ y of the forest upon which the people de@@ pend .
they have a curious language and marriage rule which is called &quot; lin@@ gu@@ istic ex@@ o@@ gam@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spea@@ ks a different language .
and this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ tho@@ logical past , yet the curious thing is in these long houses , where there are six or seven languages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ marriage , you never hear anyone pr@@ ac@@ tic@@ ing a language .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
or , one of the most fascinating tri@@ bes i ever lived with , the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n ecu@@ ad@@ or , an aston@@ ishing people first cont@@ acted pe@@ ac@@ efully in 195@@ 8 .
in 195@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ aries attemp@@ ted contact and made a critical mistake .
they dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 glo@@ ss@@ y photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friend@@ ly ges@@ tures , for@@ getting that these people of the rain@@ forest had never seen anything two-@@ dimensional in their lives .
they picked up these photographs from the forest floor , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conclu@@ ded that these were calling cards from the dev@@ il , so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ aries to death .
but the wa@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just sp@@ ear out@@ si@@ ders .
they spe@@ ar@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mortality was due to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other .
we trac@@ ed gene@@ alo@@ gies back eight generations , and we found two inst@@ ances of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lows had gotten so old that he died getting old , so we spe@@ ar@@ ed him anyway .
but at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was aston@@ ishing .
their hun@@ ters could smell animal ur@@ ine at 40 p@@ aces and tell you what species left it behind .
in the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , i had a really aston@@ ishing as@@ sign@@ ment when i was asked by my professor at harvard if i was interested in going down to hai@@ ti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the secret societies which were the foundation of du@@ val@@ ier &apos;s strength and ton@@ ton mac@@ ou@@ tes , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the pois@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
in order to make sense out of sensation , of course , i had to understand something about this remarkable faith of vo@@ dou@@ n . and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is not a black magic cul@@ t .
on the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex metaph@@ ysi@@ cal world@@ view .
it &apos;s interesting .
if i asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
chris@@ ti@@ an@@ ity , islam , bu@@ ddhis@@ m , jud@@ ais@@ m , whatever .
there &apos;s always one continent left out , the assu@@ mption being that sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa had no religious beli@@ efs . well , of course , they did and vo@@ o@@ do@@ o is simply the dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation of these very profound religious ideas that came over during the trag@@ ic di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the sl@@ aver@@ y era .
but , what makes vo@@ o@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spir@@ its .
the spir@@ its can be in@@ vo@@ ked from bene@@ ath the great water , respon@@ ding to the rhy@@ th@@ m of the dance to mom@@ ent@@ arily dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the living , so that for that bri@@ ef sh@@ in@@ ing moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te becomes the god .
that &apos;s why the vo@@ o@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; you white people go to church and speak about god .
we dance in the temp@@ le and become god . &quot;
and because you are poss@@ essed , you are taken by the spirit -- how can you be har@@ med ?
so you see these aston@@ ishing demonstr@@ ations : vo@@ o@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling burning em@@ bers with imp@@ un@@ ity , a rather aston@@ ishing demonstr@@ ation of the ability of the mind to affect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of extreme excit@@ ation .
now , of all the peop@@ les that i &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the ko@@ g@@ i of the si@@ er@@ ra n@@ ev@@ ada de s@@ anta mar@@ ta in northern col@@ om@@ bia .
descend@@ ants of the ancient t@@ air@@ on@@ a civilization which once car@@ pet@@ ed the car@@ ib@@ b@@ ean co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain of col@@ om@@ bia , in the wake of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ treated into an isol@@ ated volcan@@ ic massi@@ f that so@@ ars above the car@@ ib@@ b@@ ean co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain .
in a b@@ loo@@ d@@ st@@ ained continent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ ered by the sp@@ an@@ ish .
to this day , they rem@@ ain r@@ ul@@ ed by a ritu@@ al pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the training for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary .
the young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their families at the age of three and four , se@@ ques@@ tered in a sh@@ ado@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ kness in stone hu@@ ts at the base of glaci@@ ers for 18 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year peri@@ ods deli@@ ber@@ ately cho@@ sen to mim@@ ic the nine months of g@@ estation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
and for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the values of their society , values that maint@@ ain the proposition that their pr@@ ay@@ ers and their pr@@ ay@@ ers alone maint@@ ain the cos@@ mic -- or we might say the eco@@ logical -- balance .
and at the end of this amazing initi@@ ation , one day they &apos;re suddenly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . and in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of awar@@ eness of first light as the sun begins to ba@@ the the s@@ lo@@ pes of the stun@@ n@@ ingly beautiful landscape , suddenly everything they have learned in the abstr@@ act is affir@@ med in stun@@ ning gl@@ ory . and the pri@@ est steps back and says , &quot; you see ? it &apos;s really as i &apos;ve told you .
it is that beautiful . it is you@@ rs to protect . &quot;
they call themselves the &quot; el@@ der brothers &quot; and they say we , who are the youn@@ ger brothers , are the ones responsible for destro@@ ying the world .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
whenever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and landscape , we either in@@ vo@@ ke rou@@ ss@@ eau and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sav@@ age , &quot; which is an idea rac@@ ist in its simpli@@ city , or altern@@ atively , we in@@ vo@@ ke tho@@ re@@ au and say these people are closer to the earth than we are .
well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther senti@@ mental nor wea@@ ken@@ ed by no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a .
there &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al sw@@ am@@ ps of the as@@ m@@ at or in the ch@@ illing win@@ ds of ti@@ bet , but they have , n@@ ever@@ th@@ eless , through time and ritu@@ al , for@@ ged a traditional my@@ stique of the earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intuition : the idea that the earth itself can only exist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human consciousness .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young kid from the an@@ des who &apos;s raised to believe that that mountain is an ap@@ u spirit that will direct his or her des@@ tiny will be a prof@@ oun@@ dly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from mon@@ tan@@ a raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be min@@ ed .
whether it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spirit or a pile of ore is ir@@ relevant .
what &apos;s interesting is the metaphor that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
i was raised in the for@@ ests of british colum@@ bia to believe those for@@ ests exis@@ ted to be cut .
that made me a different human being than my friends am@@ ong@@ st the k@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ ests were the abo@@ de of hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the cro@@ o@@ ked bea@@ k of heav@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ bal spir@@ its that d@@ well@@ ed at the north end of the world , spir@@ its they would have to engage during their ham@@ at@@ sa initi@@ ation .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different re@@ alities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . take this plant here .
it &apos;s a photograph i took in the nor@@ th@@ west amaz@@ on just last apr@@ il .
this is ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psycho@@ active prepar@@ ation of the sha@@ man &apos;s re@@ per@@ toire .
what makes ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca fascinating is not the she@@ er pharmac@@ o@@ logical potential of this prepar@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . it &apos;s made really of two different sources : on the one hand , this woo@@ dy li@@ ana which has in it a series of bet@@ a-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly hallucin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue h@@ az@@ y smo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consciousness -- but it &apos;s mix@@ ed with the leaves of a sh@@ ru@@ b in the coffee family called psycho@@ tri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ dis .
this plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
if you &apos;ve ever seen the y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their no@@ ses , that substance they make from a different set of species also con@@ tains me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ meth@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine .
to have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your no@@ se is rather like being shot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ rel lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que paint@@ ings and l@@ anding on a sea of electricity .
it doesn &apos;t create the dis@@ tor@@ tion of reality ; it creates the dis@@ solution of reality .
in fact , i used to argue with my professor , richard ev@@ an sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who s@@ par@@ ked the psy@@ che@@ del@@ ic era with his discovery of the magic mus@@ h@@ rooms in mexico in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s -- i used to argue that you couldn &apos;t classi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines as hallucin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the effects there &apos;s no one home anymore to experience a hallucin@@ ation .
but the thing about tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally because they &apos;re den@@ atu@@ red by an enz@@ yme found naturally in the human gu@@ t called mono@@ amine ox@@ id@@ ase .
they can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ jun@@ ction with some other chemical that den@@ atures the ma@@ o .
now , the fascinating things are that the bet@@ a-@@ car@@ bol@@ ines found within that li@@ ana are ma@@ o in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ cise sort necessary to potenti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ ine . so you ask yourself a question .
how , in a flor@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of vas@@ cu@@ lar plants , do these people find these two mor@@ pho@@ log@@ ically un@@ related plants that when combin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chemical version of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts ?
well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; trial and error , &quot; which is ex@@ posed to be meaning@@ less .
but you ask the indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; the plants talk to us . &quot;
well , what does that mean ?
this tri@@ be , the co@@ fan , has 17 vari@@ eties of ay@@ a@@ hu@@ as@@ ca , all of which they distin@@ gu@@ ish a great distance in the forest , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our eye as one species .
and then you ask them how they estab@@ lish their tax@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; i thought you knew something about plants .
i mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; and i said , &quot; no . &quot;
well , it turns out you take each of the 17 vari@@ eties in the night of a full moon , and it sin@@ gs to you in a different key .
now , that &apos;s not going to get you a ph@@ .@@ d@@ . at harvard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ ens .
now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ thetic with the pli@@ ght of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ aint and color@@ ful but somehow re@@ duced to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , moves on .
well , the truth is the 20th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either activ@@ ely end@@ or@@ sed or pas@@ si@@ vely accep@@ ted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
all cultures through all time have constantly been engag@@ ed in a dance with new possibilities of life .
and the problem is not technology itself .
the si@@ oux indi@@ ans did not stop being si@@ oux when they gave up the bo@@ w and ar@@ row any more than an american stopped being an american when he gave up the horse and bu@@ gg@@ y .
it &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the integr@@ ity of the eth@@ no@@ sphere . it is power , the cru@@ de face of domin@@ ation .
wher@@ ever you look around the world , you discover that these are not cultures destin@@ ed to fa@@ de away ; these are dynamic living peop@@ les being driven out of existence by identi@@ fi@@ able forces that are beyond their capacity to adap@@ t to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ estation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the pen@@ an -- a nom@@ adi@@ c people from sou@@ the@@ ast asia , from sar@@ aw@@ ak -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago , and now have all been re@@ duced to serv@@ itu@@ de and pro@@ stitu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the river itself is so@@ il@@ ed with the sil@@ t that seems to be carrying half of bor@@ ne@@ o away to the south china sea , where the japanese fre@@ igh@@ ters h@@ ang light in the horizon ready to fill their holds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest -- or , in the case of the y@@ an@@ om@@ ami , it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wake of the discovery of gold .
or if we go into the mountains of ti@@ bet , where i &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cru@@ de face of political domin@@ ation .
you know , gen@@ o@@ cide , the physical extinction of a people is univers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ cide , the destruction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univers@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , celebr@@ ated as part of a development strategy .
and you cannot understand the pain of ti@@ bet until you move through it at the ground level .
i once trav@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from ch@@ eng@@ du in western china over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n ti@@ bet to l@@ has@@ a with a young colle@@ ague , and it was only when i got to l@@ has@@ a that i understood the face behind the statistics you hear about : 6@@ ,000 sac@@ red mon@@ u@@ ments tor@@ n apart to d@@ ust and ash@@ es , 1.@@ 2 million people killed by the ca@@ dres during the cultural revolution .
this young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the pan@@ chen lam@@ a .
that meant he was inst@@ antly killed at the time of the chinese inv@@ a@@ sion .
his un@@ cle fl@@ ed with his hol@@ iness in the di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to ne@@ p@@ al .
his mother was incar@@ cer@@ ated for the crime of being weal@@ thy .
he was s@@ mu@@ gg@@ led into the j@@ ail at the age of two to hi@@ de bene@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t tail@@ s because she couldn &apos;t bear to be without him .
the sister who had done that br@@ ave de@@ ed was put into an education camp .
one day she in@@ adver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an arm@@ band of ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ession , she was given seven years of hard labor .
the pain of ti@@ bet can be impossible to bear , but the red@@ emp@@ tive spirit of the people is something to beh@@ old .
and in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mono@@ chr@@ om@@ atic world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y or do we want to embr@@ ace a poly@@ chr@@ om@@ atic world of diversity ?
mar@@ gar@@ et m@@ ead , the great anthropo@@ logist , said , before she died , that her greatest fear was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly amor@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination re@@ duced to a more nar@@ row mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wake from a dream one day having for@@ gotten there were even other possibilities .
and it &apos;s hum@@ bling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 15@@ 0,000 &#93; years .
the ne@@ oli@@ th@@ ic revolution -- which gave us agriculture , at which time we suc@@ cu@@ m@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the seed ; the poetry of the sha@@ man was dis@@ placed by the pro@@ se of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; we created hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y speci@@ alization sur@@ plus -- is only 10,000 years ago .
the modern industrial world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
now , that sh@@ allow history doesn &apos;t suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing mill@@ en@@ nia .
when these my@@ ri@@ ad cultures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respond with 10,000 different voices .
and it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ discover the possibility of being what we are : a fully conscious species , fully aware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all peop@@ les and all gar@@ d@@ ens find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . and there are great moments of optimis@@ m .
this is a photograph i took at the northern ti@@ p of ba@@ ff@@ in island when i went nar@@ wh@@ al hun@@ ting with some in@@ u@@ it people , and this man , ol@@ ay@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
the can@@ adi@@ an government has not always been kind to the in@@ u@@ it people , and during the 195@@ 0s , to estab@@ lish our so@@ ver@@ e@@ ign@@ ty , we forced them into set@@ t@@ l@@ ements .
this old man &apos;s grand@@ father re@@ f@@ used to go .
the family , f@@ ear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the in@@ u@@ it did not fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
the run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wr@@ apped in car@@ ib@@ ou hi@@ de .
so , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not inti@@ mid@@ ated by the arc@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
he simply sli@@ pped outside , pulled down his se@@ al@@ skin trou@@ s@@ ers and def@@ ec@@ ated into his hand . and as the f@@ eces began to free@@ ze , he shaped it into the form of a bl@@ ade .
he put a spr@@ ay of sal@@ iv@@ a on the edge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze solid , he but@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it .
he s@@ kin@@ ned the dog and improvis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ cage of the dog and improvis@@ ed a s@@ led , har@@ n@@ essed up an ad@@ jac@@ ent dog , and dis@@ appeared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in bel@@ t .
talk about getting by with nothing .
and this , in many ways -- -- is a symbo@@ l of the res@@ ili@@ ence of the in@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
the can@@ adi@@ an government in apr@@ il of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the in@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than california and texas put together .
it &apos;s our new hom@@ el@@ and . it &apos;s called n@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
it &apos;s an independent territ@@ ory . they control all min@@ er@@ al resources .
an amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can see@@ k res@@ titu@@ tion with its people .
and finally , in the end , i think it &apos;s pretty obvious at least to all of all us who &apos;ve trav@@ eled in these remote re@@ aches of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not remote at all .
they &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
they represent bran@@ ches of the human imagination that go back to the d@@ a@@ wn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the na@@ ked ge@@ ograp@@ hy of hope .
so , what we &apos;re trying to do at the national geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never ac@@ comp@@ lish anything .
we think that pol@@ em@@ ics -- -- we think that pol@@ em@@ ics are not persu@@ a@@ sive , but we think that story@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best story@@ telling institution in the world . we get 35 million hits on our website every month .
15@@ 6 nations carry our television channel .
our magaz@@ ines are read by millions .
and what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ no@@ sphere where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural wonder that they cannot help but come away d@@ az@@ z@@ led by what they have seen , and hopefully , therefore , embr@@ ace gradu@@ ally , one by one , the central re@@ vel@@ ation of anthropo@@ logy : that this world des@@ er@@ ves to exist in a di@@ verse way , that we can find a way to live in a truly multi@@ cultural , plu@@ r@@ alistic world where all of the wisdom of all peop@@ les can contribu@@ te to our collective well-@@ being .
thank you very much .
what i &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foun@@ d@@ ational work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acqu@@ is@@ ition almost exactly a year ago . this is s@@ ea@@ drag@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either lo@@ cally or rem@@ ot@@ ely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
we &apos;re looking at many , many gig@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of digital photos here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in , p@@ ann@@ ing through the thing , re@@ arrang@@ ing it in any way we want .
and it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the images are .
most of them are ordinary digital camera photos , but this one , for example , is a scan from the library of congr@@ ess , and it &apos;s in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el range .
it doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to lim@@ it the performance of a system like this one is the number of pix@@ els on your screen at any given moment . it &apos;s also very flexi@@ ble architecture .
this is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
this is &quot; bl@@ ea@@ k house &quot; by di@@ ck@@ ens . every colum@@ n is a chap@@ ter .
to prove to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real represent@@ ation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e-@@ book .
i wouldn &apos;t re@@ comm@@ end it .
this is a more re@@ alistic case . this is an issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
and this really gives you the joy and the good experience of reading the real paper version of a magazine or a newspaper , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi-@@ scale kind of medium .
we &apos;ve also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guar@@ di@@ an .
we &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high resol@@ ution -- much higher than you &apos;d be able to get in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ be@@ dded extra content .
if you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical speci@@ fi@@ cations .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those lim@@ its on screen real est@@ ate .
we hope that this means no more po@@ p@@ -@@ u@@ ps and other kind of ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish like that -- shouldn &apos;t be necessary .
of course , ma@@ pping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and this one i really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribu@@ te to this field as well .
but those are all the roads in the u.@@ s .
super@@ im@@ posed on top of a nasa ge@@ os@@ pati@@ al image .
so let &apos;s pull up , now , something else .
this is actually live on the web now ; you can go check it out .
this is a project called photo@@ syn@@ th , which really mar@@ ries two different technologies .
one of them is s@@ ea@@ drag@@ on and the other is some very beautiful computer vision research done by no@@ ah s@@ nav@@ ely , a graduate student at the university of washington , co-@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by steve se@@ it@@ z at u.@@ w .
and ri@@ ck s@@ z@@ el@@ is@@ ki at microsoft research . a very nice collaboration .
and so this is live on the web . it &apos;s powered by s@@ ea@@ drag@@ on .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi-@@ resol@@ ution experience .
but the spatial arrang@@ ement of the images here is actually meaning@@ ful .
the computer vision algorith@@ ms have reg@@ is@@ tered these images together so that they correspond to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken near gr@@ as@@ si la@@ kes in the can@@ adi@@ an rock@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . so you see elements here of stabi@@ li@@ zed sli@@ de-@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing , and these things have all been related spati@@ ally .
i &apos;m not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
there are some that are much more spatial .
i would like to jump straight to one of no@@ ah &apos;s original dat@@ a-@@ sets -- and this is from an early prototype of photo@@ syn@@ th that we first got working in the summer -- to show you what i think is really the pun@@ ch line behind this technology , the photo@@ syn@@ th technology . and it &apos;s not necessarily so appar@@ ent from looking at the environments that we &apos;ve put up on the website .
we had to worry about the law@@ yers and so on .
this is a re@@ construction of notre dame ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done entirely compu@@ t@@ ation@@ ally from images scr@@ ap@@ ed from fli@@ ck@@ r . you just type notre dame into fli@@ ck@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in t-@@ shir@@ ts , and of the camp@@ us and so on . and each of these orange con@@ es represents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
and so these are all fli@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been related spati@@ ally in this way .
and we can just navig@@ ate in this very simple way .
you know , i never thought that i &apos;d end up working at microsoft .
it &apos;s very grati@@ fying to have this kind of re@@ ception here .
i guess you can see this is lots of different types of cameras : it &apos;s everything from cell phone cameras to professional sl@@ rs , quite a large number of them , sti@@ t@@ ched together in this environment .
and if i can , i &apos;ll find some of the sort of weird ones .
so many of them are oc@@ clu@@ ded by faces , and so on .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs -- here we go .
this is actually a pos@@ ter of notre dame that reg@@ is@@ tered correc@@ tly .
we can di@@ ve in from the pos@@ ter to a physical view of this environment .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collective memory of , visu@@ ally , of what the earth looks like -- and link all of that together .
all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emerg@@ ent that &apos;s greater than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that emerg@@ es of the entire earth .
think of this as the long tail to stephen law@@ ler &apos;s virtual earth work .
and this is something that gro@@ ws in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
their own photos are getting tag@@ ged with met@@ a-@@ data that somebody else ent@@ ered .
if somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to tag all of these sa@@ ints and say who they all are , then my photo of notre dame ca@@ the@@ dr@@ al suddenly gets en@@ rich@@ ed with all of that data , and i can use it as an en@@ try point to di@@ ve into that space , into that met@@ a-@@ verse , using everybody else &apos;s photos , and do a kind of a cross@@ -@@ mod@@ al and cross@@ -@@ user social experience that way .
and of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is immen@@ sely rich virtual models of every interesting part of the earth , coll@@ ected not just from over@@ head fli@@ ghts and from satellite images and so on , but from the collective memory .
thank you so much .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
yes . what this is really doing is disco@@ vering .
it &apos;s creating hyper@@ lin@@ ks , if you will , between images .
and it &apos;s doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the rich@@ ness of the sem@@ an@@ tic information that a lot of those images have .
like when you do a web search for images , you type in ph@@ r@@ ases , and the text on the web page is carrying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
now , what if that picture lin@@ ks to all of your pictures ?
then the amount of sem@@ an@@ tic inter@@ connection and the amount of rich@@ ness that comes out of that is really huge . it &apos;s a classi@@ c network effect .
bl@@ aise , that is truly incredible . con@@ gratu@@ l@@ ations .
thanks so much .
i &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine that i hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and i &apos;ll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
i want to start with what i call the &quot; offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
the offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
the offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of all western industrial societies .
and the offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma runs like this : if we are interested in maxim@@ izing the wel@@ f@@ are of our citizens , the way to do that is to maxim@@ ize individual freedom .
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , wor@@ th@@ while , essential to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maxim@@ ize our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to decide on our be@@ half .
the way to maxim@@ ize freedom is to maxim@@ ize choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
this , i think , is so deeply em@@ be@@ dded in the water supply that it wouldn &apos;t occu@@ r to anyone to question it .
and it &apos;s also deeply em@@ be@@ dded in our lives .
i &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is my super@@ market . not such a big one .
i want to say just a word about sal@@ ad dr@@ essing .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t count the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ gin o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic v@@ ine@@ gars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chance that none of the 17@@ 5 the store has on offer suit you .
so this is what the super@@ market is like .
and then you go to the consumer electron@@ ics store to set up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- spea@@ kers , c@@ d player , tape player , tu@@ ner , am@@ pli@@ fier -- and in this one single consumer electron@@ ics store , there are that many ster@@ e@@ o systems .
we can constru@@ ct si@@ x-@@ and-@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
you &apos;ve got to admit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
in other dom@@ ains -- the world of communications .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of tele@@ phone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
you r@@ ent@@ ed your phone . you didn &apos;t buy it .
one conse@@ quence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and those days are gone .
we now have an almost un@@ limited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
these are cell phones of the future .
my favorite is the middle one -- the mp@@ 3 player , no@@ se hair tr@@ im@@ mer , and cre@@ me bru@@ lee tor@@ ch .
and if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your store yet , you can rest assu@@ red that one day soon you will .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stor@@ es asking this question .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the answer is &quot; no . &quot;
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
so , in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care -- it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , &quot; well , we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; do@@ c , what should i do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? &quot;
and you say , &quot; if you were me , do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
and the do@@ c says , &quot; but i &apos;m not you . &quot;
and the result is -- we call it &quot; patient autonom@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shif@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsibility for decis@@ i@@ on-@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doctor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making decisions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
there &apos;s enormous marketing of pres@@ cri@@ ption drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
something as dra@@ matic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indi@@ cate .
we don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an identity ; we get to invent it .
and we get to re-@@ invent ourselves as often as we like .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the de@@ fau@@ lt assu@@ mption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , everything is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s .
i teach wonder@@ fully intelligent students , and i as@@ sign 20 percent less work than i used to .
and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ lig@@ ent .
it &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pied , asking themselves , &quot; should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? &quot;
all of these are consum@@ ing questions .
and they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i as@@ sign and not getting a good grade in my cour@@ ses .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
work -- we are bl@@ essed , as car@@ l was point@@ ing out , with the technology that en@@ ables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the rand@@ ol@@ ph hotel .
there is one corner , by the way , that i &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the wi@@ fi works .
i &apos;m not telling you about it because i want to use it .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn &apos;t be working .
we can go to watch our kid play so@@ c@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our black@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our laptop , pres@@ u@@ ma@@ bly , on our lap@@ s .
and even if they &apos;re all sh@@ ut off , every minute that we &apos;re watching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a so@@ c@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; should i answer this cell phone call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i dr@@ aft this letter ? &quot;
and even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s so@@ c@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifes@@ ty@@ le things , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what &apos;s good about it , so i &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
one effect , parado@@ x@@ ically , is that it produ@@ ces paraly@@ sis , rather than liber@@ ation .
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
i &apos;ll give you one very dra@@ matic example of this : a study that was done of invest@@ ments in volun@@ t@@ ary reti@@ rement plans .
a colle@@ ague of mine got access to investment records from v@@ angu@@ ard , the gig@@ an@@ tic mutu@@ al fund company of about a million employees and about 2,000 different work@@ places .
and what she found is that for every 10 mutu@@ al fun@@ ds the employ@@ er off@@ ered , rate of participation went down two percent .
you offer 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fewer employees particip@@ ate than if you only offer five . why ?
because with 50 fun@@ ds to choose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to decide which fund to choose that you &apos;ll just put it off until tomorrow .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
understand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they reti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the decision is so hard that they pass up significant mat@@ ching money from the employ@@ er .
by not particip@@ ating , they are pass@@ ing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the employ@@ er , who would happ@@ ily match their contribu@@ tion .
so paraly@@ sis is a conse@@ quence of having too many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to get the decision right if it &apos;s for all et@@ ern@@ ity , right ?
you don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mutu@@ al fund , or even the wrong sal@@ ad dr@@ essing .
so that &apos;s one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to over@@ come the paraly@@ sis and make a choice , we end up less satis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
and there are several reasons for this .
one of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings to choose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and , you know , what sal@@ ad dr@@ essing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine that you could have made a different choice that would have been better . and what happens is this imagin@@ ed alternative indu@@ ces you to regret the decision you made , and this regret sub@@ trac@@ ts from the satis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the decision you made , even if it was a good decision .
the more options there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ing about the option that you chose .
second , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opportunity costs . &quot;
dan g@@ il@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
well , when there are lots of altern@@ atives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attr@@ active fe@@ atures of altern@@ atives that you rej@@ ect , that make you less satis@@ fied with the alternative that you &apos;ve cho@@ sen .
here &apos;s an example . for those of you who aren &apos;t new yor@@ kers , i apo@@ logi@@ ze .
but here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
here &apos;s this couple on the ham@@ p@@ tons .
very expensive real est@@ ate .
gor@@ ge@@ ous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
what could be better ? &quot; well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; it &apos;s aug@@ ust .
everybody in my manhattan neighborhood is away .
i could be parking right in front of my building . &quot;
and he sp@@ ends two weeks n@@ ag@@ ged by the idea that he is missing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great parking space .
opportunity costs sub@@ tr@@ act from the satis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we choose , even when what we choose is terri@@ fic .
and the more options there are to consider , the more attr@@ active fe@@ atures of these options are going to be refl@@ ected by us as opportunity costs .
here &apos;s another example .
now this carto@@ on makes a lot of points .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but one point it makes is that whenever you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing one thing , you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing not to do other things .
and those other things may have lots of attr@@ active fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attr@@ active .
third : escal@@ ation of expect@@ ations .
this hit me when i went to re@@ place my je@@ ans .
i wear je@@ ans almost all the time .
and there was a time when je@@ ans came in one fl@@ av@@ or , and you bought them , and they fit like cr@@ ap , and they were incredibly un@@ comfortable , and if you wo@@ re them long enough and wash@@ ed them enough times , they started to feel ok .
so i went to re@@ place my je@@ ans after years and years of wearing these old ones , and i said , you know , &quot; i want a pair of je@@ ans . here &apos;s my size . &quot;
and the sh@@ op@@ kee@@ per said , &quot; do you want sli@@ m fit , easy fit , rela@@ x@@ ed fit ?
you want but@@ ton fly or zi@@ p@@ per fly ? you want st@@ on@@ e@@ wash@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ wash@@ ed ?
do you want them dis@@ tr@@ essed ?
you want bo@@ ot cut , you want tap@@ ered , bl@@ ah bl@@ ah bl@@ ah ... &quot; on and on he went .
my ja@@ w dro@@ pped , and after i re@@ covered , i said , &quot; i want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and i walked out of the store -- truth ! -- with the b@@ est-@@ f@@ itting je@@ ans i had ever had .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expect@@ ations about how good a pair of je@@ ans should be went up .
i had very low -- i had no particular expect@@ ations when they only came in one fl@@ av@@ or .
when they came in 100 fl@@ av@@ ors , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i got was dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ing in compar@@ is@@ on to what i expected .
ad@@ ding options to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but increase the expect@@ ations people have about how good those options will be .
and what that &apos;s going to produce is less satis@@ fac@@ tion with results , even when they &apos;re good results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a ple@@ as@@ ant surprise .
no@@ w@@ ad@@ ays , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized citizens , with perf@@ ection the expect@@ ation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
you will never be ple@@ as@@ antly surprised because your expect@@ ations , my expect@@ ations , have gone through the roof .
the secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the secret to happiness is low expect@@ ations .
i want to say -- just a little auto@@ bio@@ graphi@@ cal moment -- that i actually am married to a wife , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
i couldn &apos;t have done better . i didn &apos;t set@@ tle .
but set@@ t@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
finally , one conse@@ quence of buying a bad@@ -@@ f@@ itting pair of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ satis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible , the answer is clear : the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when there are hundreds of different sty@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ing , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsible ?
it is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you could have done better .
with a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on display , there is no ex@@ cu@@ se for failure .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ed about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
clinical depression has explo@@ ded in the industrial world in the last generation .
i believe a significant -- not the only , but a significant -- contribu@@ tor to this explosion of depression , and also suicide , is that people have experiences that are dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ing because their standards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at fau@@ lt .
and so the net result is that we do better in general , objec@@ tively , and we feel worse .
so let me re@@ mind you .
this is the offici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . it is not true .
there &apos;s no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
there &apos;s some magi@@ cal amount . i don &apos;t know what it is .
i &apos;m pretty confi@@ dent that we have long since passed the point where options improve our wel@@ f@@ are .
now , as a policy matter -- i &apos;m almost done -- as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ables all of this choice in industrial societies is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
their problem is that they have too little .
so the stuff i &apos;m talking about is the p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , western societies .
and what is so frustr@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : steve lev@@ it@@ t talked to you yesterday about how these expensive and difficul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help . it &apos;s a waste of money .
what i &apos;m telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
they actually hur@@ t .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what en@@ ables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shif@@ ted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but ours would be impro@@ ved also .
this is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; par@@ et@@ o-@@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
income re@@ distribution will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this exc@@ ess choice pl@@ agues us .
so to conclu@@ de . you &apos;re supposed to read this carto@@ on , and , being a sophisticated person , say , &quot; ah ! what does this fish know ?
you know , nothing is possible in this f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l . &quot;
im@@ pover@@ ished imagination , a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way i read it at first .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have freedom . you have paraly@@ sis .
if you sh@@ at@@ ter this f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l so that everything is possible , you dec@@ re@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
you increase paraly@@ sis , and you dec@@ re@@ ase satis@@ fac@@ tion .
everybody needs a f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l .
this one is almost certainly too limited -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
but the absence of some met@@ ap@@ hor@@ ical f@@ ish@@ bow@@ l is a reci@@ pe for mis@@ ery , and , i susp@@ ect , disaster .
thank you very much .
you know , i &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human genome and what that might mean , and disco@@ vering new sets of genes .
we &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and syn@@ thes@@ izing life .
so , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; what is life ? &quot; is something that i think many biolog@@ ists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we &apos;ve tried various appro@@ aches , par@@ ing it down to min@@ ima@@ l components .
we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we se@@ qu@@ enced the human genome , it was going from the analo@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; can we re@@ generate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
this is the map of a small organism , my@@ co@@ plas@@ ma gen@@ itali@@ um , that has the small@@ est genome for a species that can self-@@ repli@@ cate in the labor@@ atory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even smaller genome .
we &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 genes out of the 500 or so that are here .
when we look at its met@@ abo@@ lic map , it &apos;s relatively simple compared to ours -- trust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the genes that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ eld a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ ize this chromosome so we could v@@ ary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ thes@@ ize a chromosome ?
can chemistry per@@ mit making these really large molecules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
and if we do , can we bo@@ ot up a chromosome ?
a chromosome , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chemical material .
so , our pace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increasing at an exponenti@@ al pace .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our lat@@ est point would put it on , now , an exponenti@@ al curve .
we started this over 15 years ago .
it took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experiments .
but it turns out syn@@ thes@@ izing dna is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna -- 30 to 50 letters in length -- and it &apos;s a de@@ generate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more er@@ rors there are .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the er@@ rors .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of ph@@ i x@@ 17@@ 4 .
it &apos;s a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correc@@ tion and had a dna molecule of about 5,000 letters .
the exciting phase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chemical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this genetic code , made the viral particles .
the viral particles then were rele@@ ased from the cells and came back and killed the e@@ . col@@ i .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
they laugh@@ ed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hard@@ ware in a biological system .
but we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacter@@ ial chromosome -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in cass@@ ettes the size of the viruses so we could actually v@@ ary the cass@@ ettes to understand what the actual components of a living cell are .
design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accur@@ ate .
when we first se@@ qu@@ enced this genome in 199@@ 5 , the standard of accur@@ acy was one error per 10,000 base pairs .
we actually found , on res@@ equ@@ encing it , 30 er@@ rors ; had we used that original sequence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
part of the design is designing pieces that are 50 letters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0-@@ letter pieces to build smaller su@@ bun@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
you may have read that we put water@@ mar@@ ks in .
think of this : we have a four@@ -@@ letter genetic code -- a , c , g and t .
tri@@ pl@@ ets of those letters code for roughly 20 amin@@ o aci@@ ds , such that there &apos;s a single letter design@@ ation for each of the amin@@ o aci@@ ds .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sent@@ ences , thoughts .
initi@@ ally , all we did was auto@@ graph it .
some people were dis@@ ap@@ point@@ ed there was not poetry .
we designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enz@@ y@@ mes ; there are enz@@ y@@ mes that re@@ pair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 letters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to 7@@ 2,000 .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in ab@@ un@@ dance so we could sequence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely robu@@ st that you can see in a minute .
we &apos;re trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
so , this looks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball play@@ off .
when we get into these really large pieces over 100,000 base pairs , they won &apos;t any longer grow read@@ ily in e@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of molecular biology -- and so we turned to other mechan@@ is@@ ms .
we knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ o@@ log@@ ous re@@ combination that biology uses to re@@ pair dna that can put pieces together .
here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organism called de@@ in@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ cus radio@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radiation .
you can see in the top pan@@ el , its chromosome just gets blo@@ wn apart .
tw@@ el@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
these organisms can be totally des@@ ic@@ cated ; they can live in a vac@@ u@@ um .
i am absolutely certain that life can exist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ que@@ ous environment .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
here &apos;s an actual micro@@ graph of the molecule we built using these processes , actually just using y@@ east mechan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; y@@ east puts them together automati@@ cally .
this is not an elec@@ tron micro@@ graph ; this is just a regular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ graph .
it &apos;s such a large molecule we can see it with a light microscope .
these are pictures over about a si@@ x-@@ second period .
so , this is the publi@@ cation we had just a short while ago .
this is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 letters of genetic code ; it &apos;s the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight .
if we print@@ ed it out at a 10 font with no spac@@ ing , it takes 14@@ 2 pages just to print this genetic code .
well , how do we bo@@ ot up a chromosome ? how do we activ@@ ate this ?
obviously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
it &apos;s also simpl@@ er when you go into eu@@ kar@@ y@@ otes like ourselves : you can just pop out the nucl@@ eus and pop in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cl@@ oning .
with bacteria and ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a , the chromosome is integr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a complete trans@@ plant of a chromosome from one cell to another and activ@@ ate it .
we pu@@ ri@@ fied a chromosome from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- roughly , these two are as dis@@ tant as human and mi@@ ce -- we added a few extra genes so we could sel@@ ect for this chromosome , we dig@@ es@@ ted it with enz@@ y@@ mes to kill all the proteins , and it was pretty stun@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll appreci@@ ate our very sophisticated graph@@ ics here .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
this is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
we find all kinds of species that have taken up a second chromosome or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new traits in a second to that species .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have miss@@ ed much of biology .
there are enz@@ y@@ mes called res@@ tric@@ tion enz@@ y@@ mes that actually dig@@ est dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the chromosome we put in does .
it got ex@@ pressed and it recogni@@ zed the other chromosome as foreign material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new chromosome .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the character@@ is@@ tics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the genetic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
so , this may sound like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y , but we can , by moving the software of dna around , change things quite dra@@ ma@@ tically .
now i &apos;ve argu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
and i &apos;ve argu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the cam@@ brian explosion , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
why do this ?
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
we &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
to put it in context for myself : i was born in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exis@@ ted in 19@@ 4@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
we have trouble feeding , provi@@ ding fresh , clean water , medi@@ c@@ ines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it &apos;s going to be a stre@@ tch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , 30 billi@@ on-@@ plus bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to re@@ place that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there &apos;s all that co2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
the electron@@ ics industry only had a do@@ zen or so components , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
we &apos;re limited here prim@@ arily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we now have techniques , because of these rap@@ id me@@ tho@@ ds of syn@@ thesis , to do what we &apos;re calling combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gen@@ om@@ ics .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosom@@ es a day .
when you think of processing these 20 million different genes or trying to opti@@ mi@@ ze processes to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce pharmaceu@@ tic@@ als , new vacc@@ ines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
and it &apos;s just standard selection : we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ability , chemical or fuel production , vaccine production , etc .
this is a screen sn@@ ap@@ shot of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we don &apos;t know necessarily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we &apos;re foc@@ using on now four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els .
you &apos;ve seen recently , corn to eth@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experiment .
we have second@@ - and thir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out relatively soon that are sugar , to much high@@ er-@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ tan@@ e or different types of bu@@ tan@@ ol .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and lim@@ iting its avail@@ ability is if we start with co2 as its feed@@ stoc@@ k , and so we &apos;re working with designing cells to go down this road .
and we think we &apos;ll have the first four@@ th-@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
sunlight and co2 is one method ...
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other me@@ tho@@ ds .
this is an organism we described in 199@@ 6 .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water temper@@ atures .
it takes co2 to meth@@ ane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
we &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tured co2 , which can easily be pi@@ ped to sites , con@@ vert that co2 back into fuel to drive this process .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of &quot; what is life ? &quot;
we truly , you know , have mod@@ est goals of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tr@@ ol@@ -@@ chemical industry -- yeah . if you can &apos;t do that at ted , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
but also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vacc@@ ines .
you &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
i think that can be changed by building combin@@ at@@ ori@@ al vacc@@ ines in adv@@ ance .
here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolutionary tree , spe@@ eding up evolution with syn@@ thetic bacteria , ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ y@@ otes .
we &apos;re a ways away from impro@@ ving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
last year at ted i gave an introdu@@ ction to the l@@ h@@ c .
and i promis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ date on how that machine worked .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the l@@ h@@ c is the largest scientific experiment ever attemp@@ ted -- 27 kilometers in circum@@ ference .
its job is to re@@ create the conditions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
it &apos;s nothing if not ambi@@ ti@@ ous .
this is the machine below gen@@ ev@@ a .
we take the pictures of those min@@ i-@@ big b@@ ang@@ s inside det@@ ect@@ ors .
this is the one i work on . it &apos;s called the at@@ las det@@ ector -- 4@@ 4 meters wide , 22 meters in diam@@ eter .
spectac@@ ular picture here of at@@ las under construction so you can see the scale .
on the 10@@ th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by at@@ las .
it caused immense celebr@@ ation in the control room .
it &apos;s a picture of the first bea@@ m parti@@ cle going all the way around the l@@ h@@ c , colli@@ ding with a piece of the l@@ h@@ c deli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing particles into the det@@ ector .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ u@@ mp@@ h .
i don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wi@@ res .
those wi@@ res carry 13 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
now the engineers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say , &quot; no they don &apos;t . they &apos;re small wi@@ res . &quot;
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called super@@ condu@@ c@@ ting wire .
so at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degrees , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wi@@ res can take that current .
in one of the jo@@ ints between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ nets in l@@ h@@ c , there was a manufactu@@ ring def@@ ect .
so the wire he@@ ated up slightly , and its 1@@ 3,000 am@@ ps suddenly encoun@@ tered electrical res@@ istance .
this was the result .
now that &apos;s more impres@@ sive when you consider those mag@@ nets we@@ igh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
so we dama@@ ged about 50 of the mag@@ nets .
we had to take them out , which we did .
we re@@ condi@@ tion@@ ed them all , fix@@ ed them .
they &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
by the end of mar@@ ch the l@@ h@@ c will be int@@ act again .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in j@@ une or ju@@ ly , and continue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now of course , in a way those accidents re@@ ign@@ ite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it &apos;s easy to refu@@ te .
i think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ reach@@ ing , is the value of things like the l@@ h@@ c .
i will leave the final word to an english scientist , hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y dav@@ y , who , i susp@@ ect , when def@@ ending his prote@@ ge &apos;s us@@ eless experiments -- his prote@@ ge was michael far@@ ad@@ ay -- said this , &quot; nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assu@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ultimate , that there are no myster@@ ies in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are complete , and that there are no new worlds to con@@ quer . &quot;
thank you .
i am a writer .
writing books is my prof@@ ession but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
it is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong love and fascin@@ ation .
and i don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
but , that said , something kind of p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to rec@@ ali@@ br@@ ate my whole relationship with this work .
and the p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this mem@@ oir called &quot; eat , pr@@ ay , love &quot; which , dec@@ ide@@ dly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sensation , international bes@@ t@@ sel@@ ler thing .
the result of which is that everywhere i go now , people treat me like i &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
seriously -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid -- aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? &quot;
so that &apos;s reas@@ sur@@ ing , you know .
but it would be worse , except for that i happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when i first started telling people -- when i was a teen@@ ager -- that i wanted to be a writer , i was met with this same kind of , sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ based reaction .
and people would say , &quot; aren &apos;t you afraid you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
aren &apos;t you afraid the hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ation of rej@@ ection will kill you ?
aren &apos;t you afraid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a scr@@ ap hea@@ p of broken dreams with your mouth filled with bit@@ ter ash of failure ? &quot;
like that , you know .
the answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; yes . &quot;
yes , i &apos;m afraid of all those things .
and i always have been .
and i &apos;m afraid of many , many more things bes@@ ides that people can &apos;t even guess at .
like s@@ ea@@ we@@ ed , and other things that are scar@@ y .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that i &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wondering about l@@ ately , is why ?
you know , is it rational ?
is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do .
you know , and what is it specifically about creative v@@ entu@@ res that seems to make us really nervous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other care@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don &apos;t rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
it didn &apos;t -- that chemical engineering block john , how &apos;s it going ?
it just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
but to be fair , chemical engineers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a re@@ putation over the cent@@ u@@ ries for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ lic man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ ves .
we writ@@ ers , we kind of do have that re@@ putation , and not just writ@@ ers , but creative people across all gen@@ res , it seems , have this re@@ putation for being enorm@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ stable .
and all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death count in the 20th century alone , of really mag@@ nific@@ ent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
and even the ones who didn &apos;t literally comm@@ it suicide seem to be really un@@ done by their gi@@ f@@ ts , you know .
nor@@ man mail@@ er , just before he died , last interview , he said &quot; every one of my books has killed me a little more . &quot;
an extraordinary st@@ atement to make about your life &apos;s work , you know .
but we don &apos;t even bl@@ ink when we hear somebody say this because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely intern@@ alized and accep@@ ted collec@@ tively this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow in@@ her@@ ently linked and that arti@@ str@@ y , in the end , will always ultimately lead to angu@@ ish .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
are you comfortable with that -- because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- i &apos;m not at all comfortable with that assu@@ mption .
i think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
and i also think it &apos;s dangerous , and i don &apos;t want to see it per@@ pet@@ u@@ ated into the next century .
i think it &apos;s better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
and i definitely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark path of assu@@ mption , particularly given the circum@@ st@@ ance that i &apos;m in right now in my career .
which is -- you know , like check it out , i &apos;m pretty young , i &apos;m only about 40 years old .
i still have maybe another four decades of work left in me .
and it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything i write from this point forward is going to be jud@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
i should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , so j@@ es@@ us , what a thought !
you know that &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start dr@@ inking gin at nine o &apos;@@ clock in the morning , and i don &apos;t want to go there .
i would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that i love .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
and so , it seems to me , upon a lot of refl@@ ection , that the way that i have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that i have to create some sort of prot@@ ective psycho@@ logical constru@@ ct , right ?
i have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as i am writing , and my very natural anxi@@ ety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
and , as i &apos;ve been looking over the last year for models for how to do that i &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and i &apos;ve been trying to find other societies to see if they might have had better and san@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people , sort of manage the in@@ her@@ ent emotional risks of creativity .
and that search has led me to ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient rome .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
but , ancient gre@@ e@@ ce and ancient rome -- people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , o@@ .@@ k. ?
people believed that creativity was this div@@ ine attend@@ ant spirit that came to human beings from some dis@@ tant and un@@ know@@ able source , for dis@@ tant and un@@ know@@ able reasons .
the gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these div@@ ine attend@@ ant spir@@ its of creativity &quot; d@@ a@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
so@@ cr@@ ates , fam@@ ously , believed that he had a d@@ a@@ em@@ on who spoke wisdom to him from a@@ far .
the rom@@ ans had the same idea , but they called that sort of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died creative spirit a geni@@ us .
which is great , because the rom@@ ans did not actually think that a geni@@ us was a particularly cl@@ ever individual .
they believed that a geni@@ us was this , sort of magi@@ cal div@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist &apos;s studio , kind of like do@@ bby the house el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of in@@ visi@@ bly ass@@ ist the artist with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
so brilliant -- there it is , right there , that distance that i &apos;m talking about -- that psycho@@ logical constru@@ ct to protect you from the results of your work .
and everyone knew that this is how it functi@@ oned , right ?
so the ancient artist was protected from certain things , like , for example , too much n@@ arc@@ iss@@ ism , right ?
if your work was brilliant you couldn &apos;t take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died geni@@ us who had helped you .
if your work bomb@@ ed , not entirely your fau@@ lt , you know ?
everyone knew your geni@@ us was kind of la@@ me .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
and then the ren@@ aiss@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and myster@@ ies , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal creatures who take dict@@ ation from the div@@ ine .
and it &apos;s the beginning of rational human@@ ism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people re@@ fer@@ ring to this or that artist as being a geni@@ us rather than having a geni@@ us .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
you know , i think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the ves@@ sel , you know , like the font and the essence and the source of all div@@ ine , creative , un@@ know@@ able , et@@ ern@@ al myster@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsibility to put on one fragile , human psy@@ che .
it &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
it just completely war@@ ps and dis@@ tor@@ ts e@@ gos , and it creates all these un@@ man@@ age@@ able expect@@ ations about performance .
and i think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
can we do this differently ?
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative myster@@ y .
maybe not .
maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of rational human@@ istic thought in one 18 minute speech .
and there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would raise really le@@ gi@@ timate scientific susp@@ ici@@ ons about the notion of , basically fai@@ ries who follow people around ru@@ b@@ bing fai@@ ry ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .
i &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
why not think about it this way ?
because it makes as much sense as anything else i have ever heard in terms of expl@@ aining the ut@@ ter ma@@ dd@@ ening ca@@ pr@@ ici@@ ousness of the creative process .
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always be@@ have ration@@ ally .
and , in fact , can sometimes feel down@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
i had this encoun@@ ter recently where i met the extraordinary american po@@ et ru@@ th stone , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in rural virgin@@ ia , she would be out working in the fields , and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ em coming at her from over the landscape .
and she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous train of air .
and it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the landscape .
and she felt it coming , because it would sha@@ ke the earth under her feet .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like hell . &quot;
and she would run like hell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ ased by this po@@ em , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ cil fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collect it and gr@@ ab it on the page .
and other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the po@@ em would bar@@ rel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
and then there were these times -- this is the piece i never for@@ got -- she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
so , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the po@@ em pas@@ ses through her , and she gr@@ ab@@ s a pen@@ cil just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
she would catch the po@@ em by its tail , and she would pull it back@@ wards into her body as she was trans@@ cri@@ bing on the page .
and in these inst@@ ances , the po@@ em would come up on the page perfect and int@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
so when i heard that i was like -- that &apos;s un@@ c@@ anny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
that &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- i &apos;m not the pi@@ pel@@ ine !
i &apos;m a mu@@ le , and the way that i have to work is that i have to get up at the same time every day , and swe@@ at and labor and bar@@ rel through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
but even i , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even i have br@@ us@@ h@@ ed up against that thing , at times .
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
you know , even i have had work or ideas come through me from a source that i hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identify .
and what is that thing ?
and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us san@@ e ?
and for me , the best contempor@@ ary example that i have of how to do that is the musici@@ an tom wai@@ ts , who i got to interview several years ago on a magazine as@@ sign@@ ment .
and we were talking about this , and you know , tom , for most of his life he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed contempor@@ ary modern artist , trying to control and manage and domin@@ ate these sort of un@@ control@@ l@@ able creative impul@@ ses that were totally intern@@ alized .
but then he got older , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was driving down the free@@ way in los angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
and he &apos;s spe@@ eding along , and all of a sudden he hear@@ s this little frag@@ ment of mel@@ o@@ dy , that comes into his head as inspiration often comes , el@@ u@@ sive and tan@@ tal@@ izing , and he wants it , you know , it &apos;s gor@@ ge@@ ous , and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
he doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , he doesn &apos;t have a pen@@ cil , he doesn &apos;t have a tape recor@@ der .
so he starts to feel all of that old anxi@@ ety start to rise in him like , &quot; i &apos;m going to lose this thing , and then i &apos;m going to be hau@@ n@@ ted by this song forever .
i &apos;m not good enough , and i can &apos;t do it . &quot;
and instead of pan@@ ic@@ king , he just stopped .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely nov@@ el .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; ex@@ cu@@ se me , can you not see that i &apos;m driving ? &quot;
&quot; do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
if you really want to exist , come back at a more op@@ port@@ une moment when i can take care of you .
otherwise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
go bo@@ ther le@@ on@@ ard co@@ h@@ en . &quot;
and his whole work process changed after that .
not the work , the work was still of@@ t@@ enti@@ mes as dark as ever .
but the process , and the heavy anxi@@ ety around it was rele@@ ased when he took the gen@@ ie , the geni@@ us out of him where it was caus@@ ing nothing but trouble , and rele@@ ased it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this intern@@ alized , tor@@ ment@@ ed thing .
it could be this p@@ ecu@@ li@@ ar , won@@ dr@@ ous , bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange , ex@@ tern@@ al thing that was not quite tom .
so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too , and it already saved me once .
this idea , it saved me when i was in the middle of writing &quot; eat , pr@@ ay , love , &quot; and i fell into one of those , sort of p@@ its of des@@ pair that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a disaster , this is going to be the worst book ever written .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
and i started to think i should just du@@ mp this project .
but then i rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
so i just lif@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cript and i direc@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an empty corner of the room .
and i said al@@ oud , &quot; listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn &apos;t brilliant that is not entirely my fau@@ lt , right ?
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this , i don &apos;t have any more than this .
so if you want it to be better , then you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
o@@ .@@ k. but if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the hell with it .
i &apos;m going to keep writing anyway because that &apos;s my job .
and i would please like the record to refl@@ ect today that i showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
because -- in the end it &apos;s like this , o@@ .@@ k. -- cent@@ u@@ ries ago in the des@@ er@@ ts of north africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light d@@ ances of sac@@ red dance and music that would go on for hours and hours , until d@@ a@@ wn .
and they were always mag@@ nific@@ ent , because the d@@ anc@@ ers were professi@@ on@@ als and they were terri@@ fic , right ?
but every once in a while , very rar@@ ely , something would happen , and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become trans@@ cend@@ ent .
and i know you know what i &apos;m talking about , because i know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
it was like time would stop , and the d@@ ancer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would al@@ ign .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be mer@@ ely human .
he would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with div@@ in@@ ity .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
they would put their hands together and they would start to chant , &quot; all@@ ah , all@@ ah , all@@ ah , god , god , god . &quot;
that &apos;s god , you know .
curious histor@@ ical foot@@ note -- when the mo@@ ors inv@@ aded southern sp@@ ain , they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the pron@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ u@@ ries from &quot; all@@ ah , all@@ ah , all@@ ah , &quot; to &quot; ole , ole , ole , &quot; which you still hear in bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ enc@@ o d@@ ances .
in sp@@ ain , when a per@@ former has done something impossible and magic , &quot; all@@ ah , ole , ole , all@@ ah , mag@@ nific@@ ent , br@@ av@@ o , &quot; in@@ com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sible , there it is -- a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
which is great , because we need that .
but , the tric@@ ky bit comes the next morning , for the d@@ ancer himself , when he wa@@ kes up and disco@@ vers that it &apos;s tu@@ es@@ day at 11 a.@@ m. , and he &apos;s no longer a gli@@ mp@@ se of god .
he &apos;s just an aging mor@@ tal with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that he@@ ight again .
and maybe nobody will ever chant god &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
this is one of the most pa@@ in@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
but maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of angu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
but maybe if you just believed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some un@@ imagin@@ able source for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite por@@ tion of your life to be passed along when you &apos;re finished , with somebody else .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
this is how i &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how i &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as i &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be published , as the danger@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ antici@@ p@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success .
and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really psy@@ ched out about that , is , don &apos;t be afraid .
don &apos;t be dau@@ n@@ ted .
just do your job .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
if the div@@ ine , co@@ c@@ ke@@ yed geni@@ us as@@ sig@@ ned to your case dec@@ ides to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be gli@@ mp@@ sed , for just one moment through your efforts , then &quot; ole ! &quot;
and if not , do your dance any@@ how .
and &quot; ole ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
&quot; ole ! &quot; to you , non@@ eth@@ eless , just for having the she@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
thank you .
thank you .
ole !
last year i showed these two sli@@ des so that demonstr@@ ate that the arc@@ tic ice cap , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 states , has sh@@ run@@ k by 40 percent .
but this underst@@ ates the seri@@ ousness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ ic@@ kness of the ice .
the arc@@ tic ice cap is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
it exp@@ ands in winter and contr@@ acts in summer .
the next slide i show you will be a rap@@ id fa@@ st-@@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
the perman@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
as you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the annu@@ al ice in winter , and it contr@@ acts in summer .
the so@@ -@@ called perman@@ ent ice , five years old or older , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ illing out of the body here .
in 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
this is a problem because the warming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the arc@@ tic ocean , where there is a massive amount of fro@@ zen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into meth@@ ane by microbes .
compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere , that amount could double if we cross this ti@@ pping point .
already in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in al@@ as@@ ka , meth@@ ane is activ@@ ely bu@@ b@@ bling up out of the water .
professor k@@ at@@ ey wal@@ ter from the university of al@@ as@@ ka went out with another team to another sh@@ allow lake last winter .
who@@ a !
she &apos;s okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sin@@ k he@@ ats up green@@ land from the north .
this is an annu@@ al mel@@ ting river .
but the volu@@ mes are much larger than ever .
this is the k@@ anger@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q river in sou@@ th@@ west green@@ land .
if you want to know how sea level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ base ice mel@@ ting this is where it re@@ aches the sea .
these flo@@ ws are increasing very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca the largest mass of ice on the planet .
last month scientists re@@ ported the entire continent is now in negative ice balance .
and west ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea islands , is particularly rap@@ id in its mel@@ ting .
that &apos;s equal to 20 feet of sea level , as is green@@ land .
in the him@@ al@@ ay@@ as , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were glaci@@ ers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their dr@@ inking water from that mel@@ ting flow .
in the an@@ des , this gl@@ acier is the source of dr@@ inking water for this city .
the flo@@ ws have increas@@ ed .
but when they go away , so does much of the dr@@ inking water .
in california there has been a 40 percent decline in the si@@ er@@ ra s@@ no@@ w@@ pack .
this is h@@ itting the reser@@ vo@@ irs .
and the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
this dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a dra@@ matic increase in fi@@ res .
and the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ dent@@ ed rate .
four times as many in the last 30 years as in the previous 75 .
this is a completely un@@ sustainable pattern .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we &apos;ve added 70 million tons of co2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons every day to the oceans .
look carefully at the area of the eastern pacific , from the americ@@ as , ext@@ ending wes@@ tw@@ ard , and on either side of the indian sub@@ continent , where there is a radical de@@ ple@@ tion of oxygen in the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with de@@ for@@ estation , which is 20 percent of it , is the burning of fossil fu@@ els .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
the united states is one of the two largest em@@ it@@ ters , along with china .
and the propos@@ al has been to build a lot more coal plants .
but we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been can@@ cel@@ led in the last few years with some green altern@@ atives pro@@ posed .
however there is a political bat@@ tle in our country .
and the coal industries and the oil industries spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year prom@@ oting clean coal , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
that image re@@ min@@ ded me of something .
around christ@@ mas , in my home in ten@@ nes@@ see , a billion g@@ allons of coal slu@@ dge was sp@@ illed .
you probably saw it on the news .
this , all over the country , is the second largest waste stream in america .
this happened around christ@@ mas .
one of the coal industry &apos;s ads around christ@@ mas was this one .
fro@@ sty the coal man is a jol@@ ly , happy sou@@ l .
he &apos;s ab@@ un@@ dant here in america , and he helps our economy grow .
fro@@ sty the coal man is getting clean@@ er everyday .
he &apos;s affor@@ dable and ador@@ able , and workers keep their pay .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virgin@@ ia .
the largest moun@@ ta@@ int@@ op min@@ er is the head of mas@@ sey coal .
let me be clear about it . al gore , n@@ ancy pel@@ o@@ si , h@@ arry re@@ id , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
so the alli@@ ance for climate protection has launched two campaig@@ ns .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
at co@@ al@@ erg@@ y we view climate change as a very serious threat to our business .
that &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our primary goal to spend a large sum of money on an advertis@@ ing effort to help bring out and compli@@ cate the truth about coal .
the fact is , coal isn &apos;t dir@@ ty .
we think it &apos;s clean -- sm@@ el@@ ls good , too .
so don &apos;t worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
clean coal -- you &apos;ve heard a lot about it .
so let &apos;s take a tour of this stat@@ e-@@ of@@ -@@ the-@@ art clean coal facilit@@ y .
amazing ! the mach@@ in@@ ery is kind of lou@@ d .
but that &apos;s the sound of clean coal technology .
and while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming , the remarkable clean coal technology you see here changes everything .
take a good long look : this is today &apos;s clean coal technology .
finally , the positive alternative mes@@ h@@ es with our economic challenge and our national security challenge .
america is in crisis -- the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the th@@ read that lin@@ ks them all : our ad@@ diction to carbon based fu@@ els , like dir@@ ty coal and foreign oil .
but now there is a b@@ old new solution to get us out of this m@@ ess .
re@@ power america with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years .
a plan to put america back to work , make us more sec@@ ure , and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that &apos;s big enough to solve our problems .
re@@ power america . find out more .
this is the last one .
it &apos;s about re@@ power@@ ing america .
one of the fa@@ st@@ est ways to cut our depend@@ ence on old dir@@ ty fu@@ els that are killing our planet .
future &apos;s over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
new invest@@ ments to create high-@@ paying jobs .
re@@ power america . it &apos;s time to get real .
there is an old african pro@@ ver@@ b that says , &quot; if you want to go quickly , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . &quot;
we need to go far , quickly .
thank you very much .
i want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blocks .
as you figured out how to reach out and gr@@ as@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and manipul@@ ating spatial relationships .
spatial reas@@ oning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
so , as a computer scientist inspired by this uti@@ lit@@ y of our interactions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er pat@@ tie , and my collabor@@ ator je@@ ev@@ an k@@ al@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- i started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one mouse cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a digital fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ p moving around a flat des@@ k@@ top , what if we could reach in with both hands and gr@@ as@@ p information physi@@ cally , arrang@@ ing it the way we wanted ?
this question was so comp@@ elling that we decided to explore the answer , by building si@@ f@@ tables .
in a nu@@ t@@ sh@@ ell , a si@@ f@@ table is an interactive computer the size of a co@@ ok@@ ie .
they &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their motion , and they have a screen and a wi@@ reless radio .
most importantly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reach@@ ing out and gr@@ as@@ ping .
and si@@ f@@ tables are an example of a new ecosystem of tools for manipul@@ ating digital information .
and as these tools become more physical , more aware of their motion , aware of each other , and aware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to explore some new and fun interaction sty@@ les .
so , i &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
this si@@ f@@ table is con@@ figured to show video , and if i ti@@ lt it in one direction , it &apos;ll roll the video this way ; if i ti@@ lt it the other way it rol@@ ls it back@@ wards .
and these interactive por@@ traits are aware of each other .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
if they get surr@@ ounded , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
and they can also sense their motion and ti@@ lt .
one of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday ges@@ tures on data , like pour@@ ing a color the way we might pour a liquid .
so in this case , we &apos;ve got three si@@ f@@ tables con@@ figured to be paint bu@@ ck@@ ets and i can use them to pour color into that central one , where they get mix@@ ed .
if we over@@ shoot , we can pour a little bit back .
there are also some ne@@ at possibilities for education , like language , math and logic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the results immediately .
so here i &apos;m -- this is a fi@@ bon@@ ac@@ ci sequence that i &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program .
here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a ma@@ sh@@ -up between scr@@ ab@@ ble and bo@@ gg@@ le .
basically , in every round you get a rand@@ om@@ ly as@@ sig@@ ned letter on each si@@ f@@ table , and as you try to make words it chec@@ ks against a dicti@@ onary .
then , after about 30 seconds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
thank you .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
they really loved it .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don &apos;t have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is , &quot; make words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
so here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
that &apos;s our youn@@ g@@ est bet@@ a tester , down there on the right .
turns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the si@@ f@@ tables up .
so to him , they were just blocks .
now , this is an interactive carto@@ on application .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language lear@@ ners .
and this is f@@ eli@@ x , actually .
and he can bring new characters into the scene , just by lif@@ ting the si@@ f@@ tables off the table that have that character shown on them .
here , he &apos;s bringing the sun out .
the sun is ris@@ ing .
now he &apos;s brought a tr@@ actor into the scene .
the orange tr@@ actor .
good job ! yeah !
so by sha@@ king the si@@ f@@ tables and putting them next to each other he can make the characters interact -- wo@@ of !
invent@@ ing his own narr@@ ative .
hel@@ lo !
it &apos;s an open-@@ ended story , and he gets to decide how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
fly away , cat .
so , the last example i have time to show you today is a music se@@ qu@@ encing and live performance tool that we &apos;ve built recently , in which si@@ f@@ tables act as sounds like lead , bas@@ s and dru@@ ms .
each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can inj@@ ect these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want .
and you inj@@ ect it by just bu@@ mp@@ ing up the sound si@@ f@@ table against a sequence si@@ f@@ table .
there are effects that you can control live , like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter .
you att@@ ach it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
and then , over@@ all effects like temp@@ o and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so let &apos;s have a look .
we &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequence si@@ f@@ tables , arr@@ ange them into a series , ex@@ tend it , add a little more lead .
now i put a bas@@ s line in .
now i &apos;ll put some per@@ cus@@ sion in .
and now i &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dru@@ ms , so i can control the effect live .
i can speed up the whole sequence by til@@ ting the temp@@ o one way or the other .
and now i &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more expression .
i can re@@ arr@@ ange the sequence while it plays .
so i don &apos;t have to plan it out in adv@@ ance , but i can improvis@@ e , making it longer or shor@@ ter as i go .
and now , finally , i can fa@@ de the whole sequence out using the volume si@@ f@@ table , til@@ ted to the left .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ faces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we &apos;re working to bring out of the labor@@ atory .
so the thought i want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the cus@@ p of this new generation of tools for inter@@ acting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
thank you very much .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
i had somebody count the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
everybody would like to make people happ@@ ier .
but in sp@@ ite of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several cognitive tr@@ aps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive tr@@ aps .
this appli@@ es to lay@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it appli@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as mess@@ ed up as anybody else is .
the first of these tr@@ aps is a re@@ lu@@ ct@@ ance to admit complexity .
it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might res@@ tric@@ t it but , by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to adop@@ t the more complicated view of what well-@@ being is .
the second tra@@ p is a con@@ fusion between experience and memory : basically it &apos;s between being happy in your life and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concepts , and they &apos;re both lu@@ mped in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the foc@@ using illusion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any circum@@ st@@ ance that aff@@ ects well-@@ being without dis@@ tor@@ ting its importance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive tra@@ p .
there &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
now , i &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a question and answer session after one of my lec@@ tures re@@ ported a story .
he said he &apos;d been listening to the sym@@ phon@@ y and it was absolutely g@@ lor@@ i@@ ous music and at the very end of the recor@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound .
and then he added , really quite emo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
but it hadn &apos;t .
what it had ru@@ ined were the mem@@ ories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had 20 minutes of g@@ lor@@ i@@ ous music .
they coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a memory ; the memory was ru@@ ined , and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
there is an experi@@ encing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is capable of re-@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
it &apos;s the experi@@ encing self that the doctor appro@@ aches -- you know , when the doctor asks , &quot; does it hur@@ t now when i touch you here ? &quot;
and then there is a rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , and the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that keeps s@@ core , and maint@@ ains the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doctor appro@@ aches in asking the question , &quot; how have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot;
or &quot; how was your trip to al@@ ban@@ ia ? &quot; or something like that .
those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ encing self and the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess of the notion of happiness .
now , the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self is a story@@ tel@@ ler .
and that really starts with a basic response of our mem@@ ories -- it starts immediately .
we don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
and let me begin with one example .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients under@@ going a pa@@ in@@ ful proce@@ dure .
i won &apos;t go into detail . it &apos;s no longer pa@@ in@@ ful these days , but it was pa@@ in@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
they were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds .
and here are two patients .
those are their recor@@ dings .
and you are asked , &quot; who of them suff@@ ered more ? &quot;
and it &apos;s a very easy question .
clearly , patient b suff@@ ered more .
his colon@@ o@@ scop@@ y was longer , and every minute of pain that patient a had patient b had and more .
but now there is another question : &quot; how much did these patients think they suff@@ ered ? &quot;
and here is a surprise : and the surprise is that patient a had a much worse memory of the colon@@ o@@ scop@@ y than patient b .
the stories of the colon@@ o@@ scop@@ ies were different and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends -- and ne@@ i@@ ther of these stories is very inspir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dist@@ inct ...
but one of them is distinc@@ tly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse was the one where pain was at its peak at the very end .
it &apos;s a bad story .
how do we know that ?
because we asked these people after their colon@@ o@@ scop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; how bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
and it was much worse for a than for b in memory .
now this is a direct conflict between the experi@@ encing self and the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self .
from the point of view of the experi@@ encing self , clearly , b had a worse time .
now , what you could do with patient a , and we actually ran clinical experiments , and it has been done , and it does work , you could actually ex@@ tend the colon@@ o@@ scop@@ y of patient a by just keeping the tube in without j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it too much .
that will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
and if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ encing self of patient a worse off , and you have the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self of patient a and lot better off , because now you have end@@ o@@ wed patient a with a better story about his experience .
what defin@@ es a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
what defin@@ es a story are changes , significant moments and end@@ ings .
end@@ ings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending domin@@ ated .
now , the experi@@ encing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you ask : what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really strai@@ ght@@ forward .
they are lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life -- and i calcul@@ ated -- you know , the psycho@@ logical present is said to be about three seconds long .
which means that , you know , in a life there , are about 600 million of them .
in a month , there are about 6@@ 00,000 .
most of them don &apos;t leave a trace .
most of them are completely igno@@ red by the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self .
and yet , some how you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it &apos;s the fin@@ ite resource that we &apos;re spending while we &apos;re on this earth .
and how to spend it , would seem to be relevant , but that is not the story that the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self keeps for us .
so we have the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ encing self , and they &apos;re really quite dist@@ inct .
the biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
from the point of view of the experi@@ encing self , if you have a vac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the two week vac@@ ation is twice as good as the one week vac@@ ation .
that &apos;s not the way it works at all for the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self .
for the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , a two week vac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the one week vac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ ories added .
you have not changed the story .
and in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that distin@@ gu@@ ish@@ es a rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ encing self .
time has very little impact on this story .
now , the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
it is actually the one that makes decisions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two colon@@ o@@ scop@@ ies with two different surge@@ ons and is dec@@ id@@ ing which of them to choose , then the one that cho@@ o@@ ses is the one that has the memory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the surgeon that will be cho@@ sen .
the experi@@ encing self has no voice in this choice .
we actually don &apos;t choose between experiences .
we choose between mem@@ ories of experiences .
and , even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future normally as experiences .
we think of our future as antici@@ p@@ ated mem@@ ories .
and basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ r@@ anny of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self sort of drag@@ ging the experi@@ encing self through experiences that the experi@@ encing self doesn &apos;t need .
i have that sense that when we go on vac@@ ations this is very frequ@@ ently the case , that is , we go on vac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ tent , in the service of our rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self .
and this is a bit hard to justi@@ fy i think .
i mean , how much do we consu@@ me our mem@@ ories ?
that is one of the explan@@ ations that is given for the domin@@ ance of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self .
and when i think about that , i think about a vac@@ ation we had in ant@@ ar@@ cti@@ ca a few years ago , which was clearly the best vac@@ ation i &apos;ve ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other vac@@ ations .
and i probably have consum@@ ed my mem@@ ories of that three week trip , i would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
now , if i had ever opened the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ p@@ ancy .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little ap@@ petite i have for consum@@ ing mem@@ ories , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question .
why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
imagine that your next vac@@ ation you know that at the end of the vac@@ ation all your pictures will be destro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ nes@@ ic drug so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
now , would you choose the same vac@@ ation ?
and if you would choose a different vac@@ ation , there is a conflict between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conflict , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvious because , if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer .
and if you think in terms of mem@@ ories , you might get another answer .
why do we pick the vac@@ ations we do , is a problem that confron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
so you can ask : how happy is the experi@@ encing self ?
and then you would ask : how happy are the moments in the experi@@ encing self &apos;s life ?
and they &apos;re all -- happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measu@@ red ?
and , by the way , now we are capable of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ encing self over time .
if you ask for the happiness of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
this is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
it is about how satis@@ fied or ple@@ ased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn &apos;t distin@@ gu@@ ish those no@@ tions , is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and i bel@@ ong to a crowd of students of well-@@ being , who &apos;ve been mess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in precis@@ ely this way .
the distin@@ ction between the happiness of the experi@@ encing self and the satis@@ fac@@ tion of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in recent years , and there are now efforts to measure the two separ@@ ately , the gall@@ up organization has a world po@@ ll with more that half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences .
and there have been other efforts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have beg@@ un to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned , is they are really different .
you can know how satis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vice ver@@ sa .
just to give you a sense of the cor@@ relation , the cor@@ relation is about .@@ 5 .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , oh his father is six feet t@@ all , how much would you know about his he@@ ight ?
well , you would know something about his he@@ ight , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certa@@ int@@ y .
you have that much un@@ certa@@ int@@ y .
if i tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certa@@ int@@ y about how happy they are with their experi@@ encing self .
so the cor@@ relation is low .
we know something about what contr@@ ols satis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is main@@ ly being satis@@ fied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other plea@@ sures , but this is domin@@ ant .
so if you want to maxim@@ ize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what i &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stitu@@ te for well-@@ being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in california , if , say , you live in o@@ hi@@ o .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contr@@ ast between california and other places , and that contr@@ ast , say , is in climate .
well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ encing self and is not even very important to the refl@@ ective self that dec@@ ides how happy people are .
but now , because the refl@@ ective self is in charge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to california .
and it &apos;s sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
well , their experi@@ encing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen . they will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ min@@ ded of how horrible the weather was in o@@ hi@@ o .
and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well-@@ being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i &apos;ve got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gall@@ up surve@@ y .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gall@@ up surve@@ y is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
we found that with respect to the happiness of the experi@@ encing self .
when we looked at how feelings v@@ ary with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for americans , and that &apos;s a very large sample of americans , like 6@@ 00,000 , but it &apos;s a large represent@@ ative sample , below an income of 6@@ 00,000 dollars a year ...
6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get progr@@ essi@@ vely un@@ happ@@ ier the poor@@ er they get .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean i &apos;ve rar@@ ely seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ enti@@ al happiness , but lack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ ery , and we can measure that mis@@ ery very , very clearly .
in terms of the other self , the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
the more money you ear@@ n the more satis@@ fied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
but d@@ anny , the whole american end@@ e@@ av@@ or is about life , liber@@ ty , the pur@@ suit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , say for example , tax@@ ation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
you know i think that there is recogni@@ tion of the role of happiness research in public policy .
the recogni@@ tion is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u@@ k , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it &apos;s going to take a@@ while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev@@ alu@@ ation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon , how to enh@@ ance happiness , goes very different ways depend@@ ing on how you think , and whether you think of the rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ encing self .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
in the united states , efforts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me , this issue will , or at least should be , the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for invent@@ ing behavi@@ oral economics .
thank you d@@ anny k@@ ah@@ n@@ em@@ an .
i &apos;d like to share with you a discovery that i made a few months ago while writing an article for itali@@ an wired .
i always keep my thes@@ aur@@ us hand@@ y whenever i &apos;m writing anything , but i &apos;d already finished ed@@ iting the piece , and i realized that i had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what i &apos;d find .
let me read you the en@@ try .
&quot; dis@@ ab@@ led , &quot; ad@@ j@@ ective : &quot; cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed , hel@@ pl@@ ess , us@@ eless , w@@ rec@@ ked , st@@ all@@ ed , m@@ aim@@ ed , w@@ ounded , mang@@ led , la@@ me , mu@@ til@@ ated , run@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , wea@@ ken@@ ed , im@@ po@@ tent , ca@@ str@@ ated , paraly@@ zed , handi@@ cap@@ ped , sen@@ ile , dec@@ rep@@ it , l@@ ai@@ d-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cr@@ ac@@ ke@@ d-@@ up , coun@@ te@@ d-@@ out ; see also hur@@ t , us@@ eless and wea@@ k .
ant@@ on@@ y@@ ms , healthy , strong , capable . &quot;
i was reading this list out lou@@ d to a friend and at first was laugh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ di@@ cr@@ ous , but i just i &apos;d just gotten past mang@@ led , and my voice broke , and i had to stop and collect myself from the emotional sho@@ ck and impact that the ass@@ au@@ lt from these words un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed .
you know , of course this is my r@@ ag@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ aur@@ us .
i &apos;m thinking this must be an ancient print date , right .
but , in fact , the print date was the early 19@@ 80 &apos;s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
and , need@@ less to say , thank god i wasn &apos;t using a thes@@ aur@@ us back then .
i mean , from this en@@ try , it would seem that i was born into a world that perce@@ ived someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when , in fact , today i &apos;m celebr@@ ated for the opportunities and adv@@ entu@@ res my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
so , i immediately went to look up the 2009 online e@@ dition , exp@@ ecting to find a re@@ vision worth not@@ ing .
here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this en@@ try .
unfortunately , it &apos;s not much better .
i find the last two words under &quot; near ant@@ on@@ y@@ ms &quot; particularly un@@ set@@ t@@ ling , &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome . &quot;
so , it &apos;s not just about the words .
it &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it &apos;s about the values behind the words , and how we constru@@ ct those values .
our language aff@@ ects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
in fact , many ancient societies , including the gre@@ e@@ ks and the rom@@ ans , believed that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out lou@@ d brought it into existence .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence , a person who is limited , or a person who &apos;s em@@ powered ?
by ca@@ su@@ ally doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and ca@@ sting sh@@ ado@@ ws on their power .
wouldn &apos;t we want to open do@@ ors for them instead ?
one such person , who opened do@@ ors for me , was my childhood doctor at the a.@@ i@@ . du@@ pont institute in wil@@ min@@ g@@ ton , del@@ aware .
his name is dr. pi@@ zz@@ uti@@ ll@@ o .
itali@@ an american , whose name , appar@@ ently , was too difficult for most americans to pron@@ oun@@ ce , so he went by dr. p .
and dr. p always wo@@ re really color@@ ful bo@@ w ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy s@@ essions .
i had to do what seemed like in@@ nu@@ mer@@ able re@@ peti@@ tions of exer@@ cis@@ es with these th@@ ick , el@@ as@@ tic ban@@ ds -- different colors -- you know , to help build up my leg muscles .
and i h@@ ated these ban@@ ds more than anything .
i h@@ ated them , had names for them . i h@@ ated them .
and , you know , i was already b@@ arg@@ aining , as a five year-old child , with dr. p to try to get out of doing these exer@@ cis@@ es , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
and , one day , he came in to my session -- ex@@ hau@@ sti@@ ve and un@@ for@@ giving , these s@@ essions -- and he said to me , &quot; wow . ai@@ me@@ e , you are such a strong , powerful little girl , i think you &apos;re going to break one of those ban@@ ds .
when you do break it , i &apos;m going to give you a hundred bu@@ cks . &quot;
now , of course , this was a simple plo@@ y on dr. p &apos;s part to get me to do the exer@@ cis@@ es i didn &apos;t want to do before the prosp@@ ect of being the rich@@ est five year-old in the second floor ward , but what he effectively did for me was res@@ hap@@ e an awful daily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and promis@@ ing experience for me .
and i have to wonder today , to what ex@@ tent his vision , and his dec@@ lar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl , shaped my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently strong , powerful and ath@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ign@@ ite the power of a child .
but , in the previous inst@@ ances of those thes@@ aur@@ us en@@ tries , our language isn &apos;t allo@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the reality that we would all want , the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable .
our language hasn &apos;t caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
certainly , from a medical stand@@ point , my legs , laser surgery for vision imp@@ air@@ ment , ti@@ tan@@ ium k@@ ne@@ e and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ements for aging bodies that are allo@@ wing people to more fully engage with their abilities , and move beyond the lim@@ its that nature has im@@ posed on them , not to mention social net@@ working plat@@ forms , allow people to self-@@ identify , to claim their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves , so they can go al@@ ign with global groups of their own cho@@ os@@ ing .
so , perhaps technology is reve@@ aling more clearly to us now what has always been a truth , that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society , and that the human ability to adap@@ t is our greatest ass@@ et .
the human ability to adap@@ t , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have continu@@ ally wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity , and i &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission .
this phrase never sat right with me , and i always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and i think i &apos;m starting to figure out why .
impli@@ c@@ it in this phrase of over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity , is the idea that success , or happiness , is about emerging on the other side of a challeng@@ ing experience un@@ sca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my succ@@ esses in life have come about from an ability to si@@ des@@ te@@ p or circum@@ navig@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed pit@@ falls of a life with pros@@ the@@ tics , or what other people perce@@ ive as my dis@@ ability .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physi@@ cally , emo@@ tion@@ ally or both .
and i am going to suggest that this is a good thing .
ad@@ vers@@ ity isn &apos;t an obstac@@ le that we need to get around in order to res@@ u@@ me living our life .
it &apos;s part of our life .
and i tend to think of it like my sh@@ ado@@ w .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
and , certainly , i &apos;m not trying to dimin@@ ish the impact , the weight , of a person &apos;s struggle .
there is ad@@ vers@@ ity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and relative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ vers@@ ity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
so , our responsibility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ vers@@ ity , but prepar@@ ing them to meet it well .
and we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equi@@ pped to adap@@ t .
there &apos;s an important difference and distin@@ ction between the objec@@ tive medical fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ te@@ e and the subj@@ ective soci@@ et@@ al opinion of whether or not i &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
and , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and consist@@ ent dis@@ ability i &apos;ve had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those defin@@ i@@ tions .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis , or , indeed , a pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
perhaps the exis@@ ting model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the patho@@ logy itself .
by not treating the wh@@ ol@@ eness of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their po@@ ten@@ cy , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
we are effectively grad@@ ing someone &apos;s worth to our community .
so we need to see through the patho@@ logy and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
and , most importantly , there &apos;s a part@@ nership between those perce@@ ived de@@ fici@@ encies and our greatest creative ability .
so it &apos;s not about dev@@ alu@@ ing , or neg@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opportunities wr@@ apped in the ad@@ vers@@ ity .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is , not so much over@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity , as it is opening ourselves up to it , embr@@ ac@@ ing it , grap@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ rest@@ ling term , maybe even d@@ ancing with it .
and , perhaps , if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as natural , consist@@ ent and useful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the presence of it .
this year we celebr@@ ate 200@@ th birth@@ day of charles darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illustr@@ ated , i think , a truth about the human character .
to par@@ aph@@ rase , it &apos;s not the str@@ ong@@ est of the species that survi@@ ves , nor is it the most intelligent that survi@@ ves , it is the one that is most adap@@ table to change .
conflict is the gen@@ es@@ is of creation .
from darwin &apos;s work , am@@ ong@@ st others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and fl@@ our@@ ish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adap@@ tation , is our greatest human skill .
and , perhaps , until we &apos;re tes@@ ted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ vers@@ ity gives us , a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gi@@ ft .
we can re-@@ imagine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just tough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
ad@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we haven &apos;t adap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
i think the greatest ad@@ vers@@ ity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of nor@@ mal@@ cy .
now , who &apos;s normal ?
there &apos;s no normal .
there &apos;s common . there &apos;s typical . there &apos;s no normal .
and would you want to meet that poor , be@@ ige person if they exis@@ ted ?
i don &apos;t think so .
if we can change this paradig@@ m from one of achiev@@ ing nor@@ mal@@ cy to one of possibility , or po@@ ten@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dangerous , we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
anthropo@@ logists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always requi@@ red of our community members is to be of use , to be able to contribu@@ te .
there &apos;s evidence that ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical inju@@ ry , and , perhaps , because the life experience of survival of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community : they didn &apos;t view these people as broken and us@@ eless ; they were seen as rare and valuable .
a few years ago , i was in a food market in the town where i grew up in that red zone in nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n pen@@ n@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , and i was standing over a bu@@ sh@@ el of tom@@ ato@@ es .
it was summer time . i had shor@@ ts on .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , &quot; well , if it isn &apos;t ai@@ me@@ e mul@@ l@@ ins . &quot;
and i turn around , and it &apos;s this older man . i have no idea who he is .
and i said , &quot; i &apos;m sorry , sir , have we met ? i don &apos;t remember meeting you . &quot;
he said , &quot; well , you wouldn &apos;t remember meeting me .
i mean , when we met i was deli@@ vering you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
this man was dr. k@@ ean , a man i had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my birth@@ day by two weeks .
an so , my mother &apos;s pren@@ at@@ al physici@@ an had gone on vac@@ ation , so the man who deli@@ vered me was a complete str@@ anger to my parents .
and , because i was born without the fi@@ bu@@ la bone , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot , and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er , this str@@ anger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
he said to me , &quot; i had to give this pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of independ@@ ence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
the extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved newspaper cli@@ pping throughout my whole childhood , whether it was win@@ ning a second grade sp@@ elling be@@ e , mar@@ ching with the girl s@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the hal@@ lo@@ ween par@@ ade , win@@ ning my college sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my s@@ ports vic@@ tor@@ ies , and he was using it , and integr@@ ating it into teaching res@@ ident students , med students from ha@@ h@@ n@@ em@@ an@@ n medical school and her@@ sh@@ ey medical school .
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
no pro@@ g@@ no@@ sis can account for how powerful this could be as a deter@@ min@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
and dr. k@@ ean went on to tell me , he said , &quot; in my experience , unless repe@@ at@@ ed@@ ly told otherwise , and even if given a modi@@ cu@@ m of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . &quot;
see , dr. k@@ ean made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there &apos;s a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
and there &apos;s been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if i would have tr@@ aded pros@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ esh and bone legs , i wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .
i as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ mal@@ cy back then .
if you ask me today , i &apos;m not so sure .
and it &apos;s because of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them , not in sp@@ ite of the experiences i &apos;ve had with them .
and , perhaps , this shift in me has happened because i &apos;ve been ex@@ posed to more people who have opened do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and cast sh@@ ado@@ ws on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power , the human spirit is so re@@ cep@@ tive , if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
you &apos;re teaching them to open do@@ ors for themselves .
in fact , the exact meaning of the word educ@@ ate comes from the ro@@ ot word &quot; edu@@ ce . &quot;
it means , to bring forth what is within , to bring out potential .
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
there was a case study done in 1960 &apos;s britain , when they were moving from gram@@ ma@@ r schools to com@@ pre@@ hen@@ sive schools .
it &apos;s called the stre@@ aming trials . we call it trac@@ king here in the states .
it &apos;s separ@@ ating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and the a students get the tou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ ri@@ cu@@ lu@@ m , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three month period , d level students , gave them a &apos;s , told them they were a &apos;s , told them they were bright .
and at the end of this three month period , they were per@@ forming at a level .
and , of course , the hear@@ t@@ breaking , fli@@ p side of this study , is that they took the a students and told them they were d &apos;s .
and that &apos;s what happened at the end of that three month period .
those who were still around in school , bes@@ ides the people who had dro@@ pped out .
a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ ped too .
the teachers didn &apos;t know a switch had been made .
they were simply told these are the a students , these are the d students .
and that &apos;s how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , i think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed spirit , a spirit that &apos;s been cr@@ us@@ h@@ ed doesn &apos;t have hope .
it doesn &apos;t see beauty .
it no longer has our natural , child@@ like curios@@ ity and our in@@ n@@ ate ability to imagine .
if instead , we can bol@@ ster a human spirit to keep hope , to see beauty in themselves and others , to be curious and imagin@@ ative , then we are truly using our power well .
when a spirit has those quali@@ ties , we are able to create new re@@ alities and new ways of being .
i &apos;d like to leave you with a po@@ em by a four@@ teen@@ th-@@ century per@@ si@@ an po@@ et named ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , jac@@ ques dem@@ bois told me about .
and the po@@ em is called &quot; the god who only knows four words . &quot;
&quot; every child has known god , not the god of names , not the god of don &apos;@@ ts , but the god who only knows four words and keeps repe@@ ating them , saying , come dance with me &quot; come dance with me .
thank you .
for some time i have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a magici@@ an to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is &quot; something fa@@ ke is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
in other words , sugar p@@ ills have a measur@@ able effect in certain kinds of studies , the plac@@ e@@ bo effect , just because the person thinks that what &apos;s happening to them is a pharmaceu@@ tical or some sort of a ...
for pain management , for example , if they believe it enough there is a measur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ bo effect .
something fa@@ ke becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perception of it .
in order for us to understand each other i want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple magic trick .
and i &apos;m going to show you how it works . this is a trick that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s magic book since at least the 195@@ 0s .
i learned it myself from cu@@ b sc@@ out magic in the 197@@ 0s .
i &apos;ll do it for you , and then i &apos;ll explain it .
and then i &apos;ll explain why i explained it .
so , here is what happens .
the k@@ ni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
i &apos;m just going to hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this .
i &apos;ll get my sle@@ eve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve i &apos;m just going to squ@@ ee@@ ze my wr@@ ist right here .
that way you can see that at no time can anything travel . as long as i &apos;m squ@@ ee@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ eve .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i &apos;m going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal mag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m will hold the k@@ ni@@ fe .
in fact it &apos;s held so ti@@ ghtly in place that i can sha@@ ke it , and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off .
nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , no tric@@ k@@ ery . and you can exam@@ ine everything .
ta@@ -@@ da !
so , this is a trick that i often teach to young children that are interested in magic , because you can learn a great deal about dec@@ e@@ ption by studying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple trick me@@ tho@@ do@@ log@@ ically .
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
what happens is this .
i hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my hand .
i say i &apos;m going to gr@@ ab hold of my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ eve , that is a lie .
the reason i &apos;m holding onto my wr@@ ist is because that &apos;s actually the secret of the illusion .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my inde@@ x finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position point@@ ing out like this .
nice one .
someone who didn &apos;t have a childhood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as i move around my finger shif@@ ts .
and we could talk about why this is dec@@ ep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn &apos;t count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that &apos;s not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
obviously it &apos;s cl@@ inging there , not by animal mag@@ ne@@ tis@@ m , but by chic@@ an@@ ery , my inde@@ x finger being there .
and then when i close my finger , same thing , as i move back , this motion kind of co@@ vers the moving back of my finger .
i take this hand away . you give the k@@ ni@@ fe out .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ bo effect ?
i read a study , a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wide open .
i &apos;m not a doctor or a resear@@ cher , so this , to me , was an aston@@ ishing thing .
it turns out that if you adminis@@ ter a plac@@ e@@ bo in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like aspir@@ in shaped , it &apos;s just a round white p@@ ill , it has some certain measur@@ able effect .
but if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ bo in , like you make a smaller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and st@@ amp a letter into it , it is actually measur@@ ably more effective .
even though ne@@ i@@ ther one of these things has any pharmaceu@@ tical -- they &apos;re sugar p@@ ills .
but a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
what ? that really fli@@ pped me out .
turns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it stop@@ s .
if you have cap@@ su@@ les , they are more effective than tabl@@ ets in any form .
a colo@@ red cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
do@@ sage has something to do with this .
one p@@ ill twice a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- i don &apos;t remember the statisti@@ c now . sorry .
but the point is ...
... these do@@ sages have something to do with it .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in plac@@ e@@ bo you &apos;ve go to the need@@ le .
right ? a sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge with some in@@ ert -- a couple c@@ cs of some in@@ ert something , and you inj@@ ect this into a patient ...
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much str@@ onger than the white p@@ ill .
it &apos;s a really , this graph , well i &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
the point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le , is not as good as the need@@ le .
and none of it has any real pharmaceu@@ tical quality .
it &apos;s only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a str@@ onger effect .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and take something that is obviously a fa@@ ke trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality you go to the need@@ le .
this is a seven in@@ ch h@@ at pin@@ . it &apos;s very very shar@@ p .
and i &apos;m going to just st@@ eri@@ li@@ ze it a tiny bit .
this is really my fl@@ esh . this is not dam@@ ian &apos;s special grown fl@@ esh .
that &apos;s my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
i &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this need@@ le through to the other side .
if you &apos;re qu@@ easy -- if you fa@@ int easily -- i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , i suggest if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , i &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
you &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fl@@ esh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
i &apos;m sorry man . am i fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe trick .
sort of .
but you can &apos;t count my fingers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
yes , well ...
i know what people think when they see this .
they go , &quot; well , he &apos;s certainly not du@@ m@@ b enough to st@@ ab himself through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
so , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
how &apos;s that look out there ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back go , &quot; okay . i didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
people in the satellite room are starting to move in now .
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
that &apos;s my fl@@ esh , and i can tw@@ ist that around .
i &apos;m sorry . if you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , &quot; well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ eding .
well let me work up some blood for you .
yes , there it is .
normally now , i would take the need@@ le out .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no w@@ ounds , but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , i &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
i hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . thank you very much .
i &apos;m j@@ ane mc@@ gon@@ ig@@ al . i &apos;m a game designer .
i &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years .
and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
now , i have a plan for this , and it ent@@ ails convinc@@ ing more people , including all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , &quot; that &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games . &quot;
maybe too much time , consider@@ ing how many ur@@ gent problems we have to solve in the real world .
but actually , according to my research , at the institute for the future , it &apos;s actually the opposite is true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dra@@ ma@@ tically .
i &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total we need at 21 billion hours of game play every week .
so , that &apos;s probably a bit of a counter@@ intuitive idea , so , i &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in .
if we want to solve problems like hun@@ ger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , ob@@ es@@ ity , i believe that we need to asp@@ ire to play games online for at least 21 billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
no . i &apos;m serious . i am .
here &apos;s why . this picture pretty much su@@ ms up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
this is a portrait by a photograp@@ her named ph@@ il tol@@ ed@@ ano .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gam@@ ing .
so , he set up a camera in front of gam@@ ers while they were playing .
and this is a classi@@ c gam@@ ing emotion .
now , if you &apos;re not a gam@@ er you might miss some of the nu@@ ance in this photo .
you probably see the sense of ur@@ gency , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , deep deep focus on t@@ ack@@ ling a really difficult problem .
if you are a gam@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ ances here , the cr@@ in@@ k@@ le of the eyes up , and around the mouth is a sign of optimis@@ m .
and the ey@@ e@@ bro@@ ws up is surprise .
this is a gam@@ er who is on the ver@@ ge of something called an epi@@ c win .
oh , you &apos;ve heard of that . okay . good .
so we have some gam@@ ers among us .
an epi@@ c win is an out@@ come that is so extraordin@@ arily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achiev@@ ed it .
it was almost beyond the th@@ res@@ hold of imagination .
and when you get there you are sho@@ cked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an epi@@ c win .
this is a gam@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of probl@@ em@@ -@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the obstacles of the next century .
the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds is on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gent problems .
this is what i call the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .
and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
this is actually me making the &quot; i &apos;m not good at life &quot; face .
this is a piece of gr@@ aff@@ it@@ i in my old neighborhood in ber@@ kel@@ ey , california , where i did my ph@@ d on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
and this is a problem that a lot of gam@@ ers have .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and i don &apos;t mean just good as in successful , although that &apos;s part of it .
we do achieve more in game worlds . but i also but i also mean good as in motiv@@ ated to do something that matters , inspired to collabor@@ ate and to co@@ operate .
and when we &apos;re in game worlds i believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves , the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to stick with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after failure and try again .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we con@@ front obstacles , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
we feel over@@ come .
we feel overwhel@@ med .
we feel anxi@@ ous , maybe de@@ pressed , frustr@@ ated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
we never have those feelings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t exist in games .
so , that &apos;s what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t achieve everything ?
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to re@@ al-@@ world work ?
so , i looked at games like world of war@@ craft , which is really the id@@ eal collabor@@ ative problem solving environment .
and i started to notice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in online worlds .
so , the first thing is , whenever you show up in one of these online games especially in world of war@@ craft , there are lots and lots of different characters who are willing to trust you with a worl@@ d-@@ saving mission , right away .
but not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perfectly mat@@ ched with your current level in the game . right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you can &apos;t achieve .
but it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re capable of . so , you have to try hard .
but there is no un@@ employ@@ ment in world of war@@ craft .
there is no sitting around wr@@ inging your hands .
there is always something specific and important to be done .
and there are also tons of collabor@@ ators .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epi@@ c mission .
it &apos;s not something that we have in real life that easily , this sense that at our fin@@ ger@@ ti@@ ps are tons of collabor@@ ators .
and also there is this epi@@ c story , this inspir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you guys have heard of lev@@ eling up and pl@@ us@@ -@@ one strength , and pl@@ us@@ -@@ one intelligence .
we don &apos;t get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when i get off this stage i &apos;m not going to have pl@@ us@@ -@@ one speaking , and pl@@ us@@ -@@ one crazy idea , pl@@ us@@ -@@ 20 crazy idea .
i don &apos;t get that feedback in real life .
now , the problem with collabor@@ ative online environments like world of war@@ craft is that it &apos;s so satis@@ fying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time , that we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds .
it &apos;s just better than reality .
so , so far , collec@@ tively all the world of war@@ craft gam@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years solving the virtual problems of az@@ er@@ oth .
now , that &apos;s not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
but to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ li@@ est prim@@ ate human ancest@@ ors stood up .
that was the first u@@ pri@@ ght prim@@ ate .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we &apos;re currently inves@@ ting in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it , is to talk about time at the mag@@ n@@ itu@@ de of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
but it &apos;s also ap@@ t . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we are actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
we are evol@@ ving to be a more collabor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
this is true . i believe this .
so , consider this really interesting statisti@@ c .
it was recently published by a resear@@ cher at car@@ ne@@ gie m@@ ell@@ on university .
the average young person today in a country with a strong gam@@ er culture will have spent 10,000 hours playing online games , by the age of 21 .
now 10,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fif@@ th grade to high school gradu@@ ation if you have perfect attend@@ ance .
so , we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l track of education going on where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good gam@@ er as they are learning about everything else in school .
and some of you have probably read mal@@ com gl@@ ad@@ well &apos;s new book out@@ li@@ ers .
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the 10,000 hour theory of success .
it &apos;s based on this great cognitive science research that if we can master 10,000 hours at effor@@ t@@ ful study , at anything by the age of 21 , we will be virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at it .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
and so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers .
so , the big question is , &quot; what exactly are gam@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
because if we could figure that out we would have a virtu@@ ally un@@ pre@@ ce@@ dent@@ ed human resource on our hands .
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our virtu@@ o@@ so gam@@ ers .
500 million people who are extraordin@@ arily good at something .
and in the next decade we &apos;re going to have another billion gam@@ ers who are extraordin@@ arily good at whatever that is .
if you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
the game industry is developing con@@ so@@ les that are low energy and that work with the wi@@ reless phone networks instead of broad@@ band internet so that gam@@ ers all over the world , particularly in india , china , braz@@ il , can get online .
they expect one billion more gam@@ ers in the next decade .
it will bring us up to 1.@@ 5 billion gam@@ ers .
so , i &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at .
here are the four things i came up with . the first is ur@@ gent optimis@@ m .
okay . think of this as extreme self-@@ motivation .
ur@@ gent optimis@@ m is the desire to act immediately to t@@ ack@@ le an obstac@@ le , combin@@ ed with the belief that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of success .
gam@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
gam@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
gam@@ ers are virtu@@ o@@ so@@ s at we@@ aving a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c .
there is a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us bad@@ ly .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they &apos;ll stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
and so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up bon@@ ds and trust and co@@ operation .
and we actually build str@@ onger social relationships as a result .
bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivity . i love it .
you know there is a reason why the average world of war@@ craft gam@@ er plays for 22 hours a week , kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
it &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard , than we are rela@@ x@@ ing , or hang@@ ing out .
we know that we are opti@@ mi@@ zed , as human beings , to do hard meaning@@ ful work .
and gam@@ ers are willing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
finally , epi@@ c meaning .
gam@@ ers love to be atta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ inspir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
so , just one bit of tri@@ via that helps put that into perspective .
so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wi@@ ki in the world .
second biggest wi@@ ki , in the world , with nearly 8@@ 0,000 articles is the world of war@@ craft wi@@ ki .
five million people use it every month .
they have comp@@ il@@ ed more information about world of war@@ craft on the internet than any other top@@ ic covered on any other wi@@ ki in the world .
they are building an epi@@ c story .
they are building an epi@@ c knowledge resource about the world of war@@ craft .
okay , so these are four super@@ powers that add up to one thing .
gam@@ ers are super-@@ em@@ powered hop@@ eful individuals .
these are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that &apos;s the problem that i &apos;m trying to solve .
there is an econom@@ ist named ed@@ ward ca@@ str@@ on@@ o@@ va .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are inves@@ ting so much time and energy and money , in online worlds .
and he says , &quot; we &apos;re wit@@ n@@ essing what amounts to no less than a mass ex@@ od@@ us to virtual worlds and online game environments . &quot;
and he &apos;s an econom@@ ist . so , he &apos;s rational .
and he says ...
not like me -- i &apos;m a game designer ; i &apos;m exu@@ ber@@ ant .
but he says , that this makes perfect sense , because gam@@ ers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
they can have str@@ onger social relationships in games than they can have in real life .
they get better feedback and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gam@@ ers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
but it is not , by any means , an opti@@ mal situation .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened 2,@@ 500 years ago .
these are ancient di@@ ce , made out of she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les . right ?
before we had aw@@ es@@ ome game control@@ ers we had she@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
and these represent the first game equipment designed by human beings .
and if you &apos;re familiar with the work of the ancient gre@@ ek histor@@ ian , her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history .
which is the history of who invented games and why .
her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that games , particularly di@@ ce games were invented in the king@@ dom of ly@@ dia during a time of famine .
appar@@ ently , there was such a sev@@ ere famine , that the king of ly@@ dia decided that they had to do something crazy .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation . they needed an extreme solution .
so , according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they invented di@@ ce games and they set up a king@@ dom@@ -@@ wide policy .
on one day , everybody would eat .
and on the next day , everybody would play games .
and they would be so immer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games because games are so engag@@ ing , and immer@@ se us in such satis@@ fying bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivity , they would igno@@ re the fact that they had no food to eat .
and then on the next day , they would play games .
and on the next day they would eat .
and according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they passed 18 years this way , survi@@ ving through a famine , by eating on one day , and playing games on the next .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we &apos;re using games today .
we &apos;re using games to es@@ cape re@@ al-@@ world suffering .
we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s broken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not satis@@ fying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
but it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
this is really exciting .
according to her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the famine wasn &apos;t getting better , so , the king decided they would play one final di@@ ce game .
they divi@@ ded the entire king@@ dom in half .
they played one di@@ ce game , and the win@@ ners of that game got to go on an epi@@ c adv@@ enture .
they would leave ly@@ dia , and they would go out in search of a new place to live , leaving behind just enough people to survive on the resources that were available , and hopefully to take the civilization somewhere else where they could th@@ ri@@ ve .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
but recently , dna evidence has shown that the e@@ tr@@ us@@ cans , who lead to the rom@@ an empire , actually share the same dna as the ancient ly@@ di@@ ans .
and so , recently , scientists have sugges@@ ted that her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos;s crazy story is actually true .
and ge@@ o@@ logists have found evidence of a global co@@ ol@@ ing that la@@ sted for nearly 20 years that could have explained the famine .
so , this crazy story might be true .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
okay , we can do that .
we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft since 199@@ 4 .
that was the first re@@ al-@@ time strategy game from the world of war@@ craft series . that was 16 years ago .
they played di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing war@@ craft for 16 years .
i say we are ready for our own epi@@ c game .
now , they had half the civilization go off in search of a new world .
so , that &apos;s where i get my 21 billion hours a week of gam@@ e-@@ play from .
let &apos;s get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve re@@ al-@@ world problems .
now , i know you &apos;re asking , &quot; how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? &quot; well , that &apos;s what i have dev@@ ot@@ ed my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
we have this b@@ ann@@ er in our off@@ ices in pal@@ o al@@ to , and it ex@@ pr@@ esses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the best case scen@@ ario out@@ come and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a reality .
we want to imag@@ ing epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to achieve the epi@@ c win .
i &apos;m just going to very bri@@ e@@ fly show you three games that i &apos;ve made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epi@@ c w@@ ins in their own fu@@ tures .
so , this is world without oil .
we made this game in 2007 .
this is an online game in which you try to survive an oil shor@@ t@@ age .
the oil shor@@ t@@ age is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online content out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . so , when you come to the game you sign up , you tell us where you live .
and then we give you re@@ al-@@ time news videos data fe@@ eds that show you exactly how much oil costs , what &apos;s not available , how food supply is being affected , how transport@@ ation is being affected , if schools are closed , if their is ri@@ oting .
and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . and then we ask you to blog about it , to post videos , to post photos .
we pil@@ ot@@ ed this game with 1,@@ 700 players in 2007 .
and we &apos;ve trac@@ ked them for the three years since .
and i can tell you that this is a transforma@@ tive experience .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we are supposed to .
but if you immer@@ se them in an epi@@ c adv@@ enture and tell them , &quot; we &apos;ve run out of oil . &quot;
this is an amazing story and adv@@ enture for you to go on .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive .
most of our players have kept up the hab@@ its that they learned in this game .
so , for the next worl@@ d-@@ saving game , we decided to aim higher , bigger problem than just peak oil .
we did a game called super@@ struc@@ t at the institute for the future .
and the pre@@ mise was , a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 23 years left on the planet .
this super@@ computer was called the global extinction awar@@ eness system , of course .
we asked people to come online almost like a jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ heimer movie .
you know jer@@ ry bru@@ ck@@ heimer movies , you form a dream team .
you &apos;ve got the astron@@ aut , the scientist , the ex@@ -@@ convic@@ t , and they all have something to do to save the world .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said everybody is on the dream team , and it &apos;s your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net .
we had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
they came up with 500 in@@ san@@ ely creative solutions that you can go online , if you google &quot; super@@ struc@@ t &quot; , and see .
so , finally , the last game , we &apos;re laun@@ ching it mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
if you complete the game you will be certi@@ fied by the world bank institute , as a social innov@@ ator , class of 2010 .
working with univer@@ si@@ ties all over sub-@@ sahar@@ an africa , and we are inv@@ iting them to learn social innovation skills .
we &apos;ve got a graphi@@ c nov@@ el . we &apos;ve got lev@@ eling up in skills like local insi@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision , and res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful@@ ness .
i would like to invite all of you to please share this game with young people , anywhere in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benefit from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ prises to save the world .
so , i &apos;m going to w@@ ra@@ p up now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we &apos;ve got all these amazing gam@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of pil@@ ots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gam@@ ers are a human resource that we can use to do re@@ al-@@ world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
we have all these amazing super@@ powers , bli@@ ss@@ ful produc@@ tivity , the ability to we@@ ave a ti@@ ght social fabri@@ c , this feeling of ur@@ gent optimis@@ m , and the desire for epi@@ c meaning .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and that &apos;s my hope that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
when i look forward to the next decade , i know two things for sure , that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want .
so , i say let the worl@@ d-@@ changing games begin .
thank you .
i &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
and that might seem a bit surprising because my ful@@ l-@@ time work at the foundation is mostly about vacc@@ ines and see@@ ds , about the things that we need to invent and deliver to help the poor@@ est two billion live better lives .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people , in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
the climate getting worse , means that many years their cro@@ ps won &apos;t grow .
there will be too much rain , not enough rain .
things will change in ways that their fragile environment simply can &apos;t support .
and that leads to star@@ vation . it leads to un@@ certa@@ int@@ y . it leads to un@@ rest .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
also , the price of energy is very important to them .
in fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to reduce poverty , by far , you would pick energy .
now , the price of energy has come down over time .
really , advanced civilization is based on adv@@ ances in energy .
the coal revolution fu@@ eled the industrial revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 00 &apos;s we &apos;ve seen a very rap@@ id decline in the price of electricity , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
and so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it che@@ aper -- and let &apos;s go for making it twice as cheap -- we need to meet a new con@@ str@@ aint , and that con@@ str@@ aint has to do with co2 .
co2 is warming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on co2 is actually a very strai@@ ght@@ forward one .
if you sum up the co2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that leads to a temperature increase , and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects .
the effects on the weather and , perhaps worse , the indi@@ rec@@ t effects , in that the natural eco@@ systems can &apos;t ad@@ just to these rap@@ id changes , and so you get ecosystem collap@@ ses .
now , the exact amount of how you map from a certain increase of co2 to what temperature will be and where the positive feed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certa@@ int@@ y there , but not very much .
and there &apos;s certainly un@@ certa@@ int@@ y about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
i asked the top scientists on this several times , do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ?
and the answer is that , until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so that &apos;s a big challenge .
it &apos;s very different than saying we &apos;re a 12 ft high tru@@ ck trying to get under a 10 ft bridge , and we can just sort of squ@@ ee@@ ze under .
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon di@@ oxide every year , over 26 billion tons .
for each american , it &apos;s about 20 tons .
for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
it &apos;s an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it &apos;s been constantly going up .
it &apos;s only various economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rapidly ris@@ ing to falling , and falling all the way to zero .
this equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors .
a little bit of multipli@@ cation .
so , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , co2 , that you want to get to zero , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the services each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the co2 being put out per unit of energy .
so , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look .
first we &apos;ve got population .
now , the world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
that &apos;s hea@@ ded up to about nine billion .
now , if we do a really great job on new vacc@@ ines , health care , re@@ productive health services , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an increase of about 1.@@ 3 .
the second factor is the services we use .
this en@@ compas@@ ses everything , the food we eat , clo@@ thing , tv , he@@ ating .
these are very good things , and getting rid of poverty means provi@@ ding these services to almost everyone on the planet .
and it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services deli@@ vered per person .
here we have a very basic service .
do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your hom@@ ework , and , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and reading their school work under the street lam@@ ps .
now , efficiency , e , the energy for each service , here , finally we have some good news .
we have something that &apos;s not going up .
through various inv@@ entions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different types of cars , different ways of building buildings .
there are a lot of services where you can bring the energy for that service down quite subst@@ anti@@ ally , some individual services even , bring it down by 90 percent .
there are other services like how we make ferti@@ liz@@ er , or how we do air transport , where the rooms for impro@@ vement are far , far less .
and so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re optimis@@ tic , we may get a redu@@ ction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three fac@@ tors now , we &apos;ve gone from 26 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion tons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
so let &apos;s look at this fourth factor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of co2 put out per each unit of energy .
and so the question is , can you actually get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
almost every way we make electricity today , except for the emerging ren@@ e@@ w@@ ables and nuclear , puts out co2 .
and so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
and so , we need energy mirac@@ les .
now , when i use the term miracle , i don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
the micro@@ process@@ or is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
so , the people here have particip@@ ated in the creation of many mirac@@ les .
usually , we don &apos;t have a dea@@ d@@ line , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
this is a case where we actually have to drive full speed and get a miracle in a pretty ti@@ ght time line .
now , i thought , how could i really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illustr@@ ation , some demonstr@@ ation that would gr@@ ab people &apos;s imagination here ?
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os , and somehow people enjo@@ yed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mo@@ squ@@ it@@ os .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
i decided that rele@@ as@@ ing fi@@ re@@ flies would be my contribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
so here we have some natural fi@@ re@@ flies .
i &apos;m told they don &apos;t b@@ ite , in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
now , there &apos;s all sorts g@@ im@@ mic@@ ky solutions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
we need solutions , either one or several , that have un@@ believ@@ able scale and un@@ believ@@ able reli@@ ability , and , although there &apos;s many directions people are see@@ king , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
i &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , ge@@ other@@ mal , fusion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
those may make some contribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look dau@@ n@@ ting , because they all have significant challenges .
let &apos;s look first at the burning fossil fu@@ els , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
what you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the co2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a liquid , put it somewhere , and hope it st@@ ays there .
now we have some pil@@ ot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full percentage , that will be very tric@@ ky , and agre@@ e@@ ing on where these co2 quanti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the tou@@ gh@@ est one here is this long term issue .
who &apos;s going to be sure ?
who &apos;s going to guar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that &apos;s a tough one .
next , would be nuclear .
it also has three big problems .
cost , particularly in highly regul@@ ated countries , is high .
the issue of the safety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fuel doesn &apos;t get used for weapons .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of concer@@ ns about that .
people need to feel good about it .
so three very tough problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , i &apos;ve grou@@ ped together .
these are what people often re@@ fer to as the ren@@ e@@ w@@ able sources .
and they actually -- although it &apos;s great they don &apos;t require fuel -- they have some dis@@ adv@@ antages .
one is that the den@@ sity of energy gather@@ ed in these technologies is dra@@ ma@@ tically less than a power plant .
this is energy farm@@ ing , so you &apos;re talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are inter@@ mit@@ tent sources .
the sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
and so , if you de@@ pend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ ods that it &apos;s not available .
so , we &apos;ve got big cost challenges here .
we have transmission challenges .
for example , say this energy source is outside your country , you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
and , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
and , to dimen@@ sion@@ alize this , i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made , for cars , for computers , for phones , for fl@@ ash@@ lights , for everything , and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big break@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a factor of a hundred better than the appro@@ aches we have now .
it &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ tent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
if you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this : what &apos;s the right approach ?
is it a manhattan project ? what &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say they &apos;re crazy . that &apos;s good .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
bill gro@@ ss has several companies , including one called es@@ ol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
v@@ in@@ od k@@ ho@@ s@@ la &apos;s inves@@ ting in do@@ z@@ ens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities , and i &apos;m trying to help back that .
na@@ than my@@ h@@ r@@ vol@@ d and i actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
there are some innovations in nuclear : modu@@ lar , liquid .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas l@@ aying around is not all that surprising .
the idea of ter@@ ra@@ power is that , instead of burning a part of ur@@ an@@ ium , the one percent , which is the u@@ 2@@ 35 , we decided , let &apos;s burn the 99 percent , the u@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 .
it is kind of a crazy idea .
in fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never simul@@ ate proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ vent of modern super@@ computers that now you can simul@@ ate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
and , because you &apos;re burning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost pro@@ file .
you actually burn up the waste , and you can actually use as fuel all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver waste from today &apos;s re@@ actors .
so , instead of wor@@ rying about them , you just take that . it &apos;s a great thing .
it brea@@ thes this ur@@ an@@ ium as it goes along . so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
you can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often re@@ fer@@ red to as a traveling wave re@@ actor .
in terms of fuel , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
i &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in k@@ entu@@ cky .
this is the left over , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they burn now , so it &apos;s called de@@ pl@@ et@@ ed ur@@ an@@ ium .
that would power the u.s. for hundreds of years .
and , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing sea water in an in@@ expensive process , you &apos;d have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet .
so , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let &apos;s think , how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
for 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent redu@@ ction .
that really is very important , that we get there .
and that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some agriculture .
hopefully , we will have clean@@ ed up for@@ es@@ try , cement .
so , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , including countries like china , will have had to switch their electricity generation al@@ together .
so , the other grade is , are we de@@ plo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology , have we de@@ plo@@ yed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where .
that &apos;s super important .
that &apos;s a key el@@ ement of making that report card .
so , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
we should go through these efficiency mea@@ sures to start getting re@@ duc@@ tions .
the less we em@@ it , the less that sum will be of co2 , and , therefore , the less the temperature .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these break@@ through@@ s .
these break@@ through@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , pil@@ ot projects , regul@@ atory things that have been changed .
there &apos;s a lot of great books that have been written about this .
the al gore book , &quot; our choice &quot; and the david m@@ ck@@ ay book , &quot; sustainable energy without the hot air . &quot;
they really go through it and create a framework that this can be discus@@ sed broad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
there &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it &apos;s a very concre@@ te wish that we invent this technology .
if you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years , i could pick who &apos;s president , i could pick a vaccine , which is something i love , or i could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no co2 gets invented , this is the wish i would pick .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u.s. and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
what am i appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
we need to go for more research fun@@ ding .
when countries get together in places like cop@@ enh@@ ag@@ en , they shouldn &apos;t just discus@@ s the co2 .
they should discus@@ s this innovation ag@@ enda , and you &apos;d be stun@@ ned at the ridi@@ cul@@ ously low levels of spending on these innov@@ ative appro@@ aches .
we do need the market incenti@@ ves , co2 ta@@ x , cap and trade , something that gets that price signal out there .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this dialogue be a more rational , more underst@@ and@@ able dialogue , including the steps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
thank you . just so i understand more about ter@@ ra@@ power , right -- i mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is ?
to actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , h@@ ire all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russi@@ an re@@ actor to make sure our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
the tough thing is building the pil@@ ot re@@ actor , finding the several billion , finding the regul@@ ator , the location that will actually build the first one of these .
once you get the first one built , if it works as advertis@@ ed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the economics , the energy den@@ sity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
and so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a vertical kind of colum@@ n of nuclear fuel , of this sort of spent ur@@ an@@ ium , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
that &apos;s right . today , you &apos;re always refu@@ eling the re@@ actor , so you have lots of people and lots of contr@@ ols that can go wrong , that thing where you &apos;re opening it up and moving things in and out .
that &apos;s not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same complex@@ i@@ ties .
and it just s@@ its there and bur@@ ns for the six@@ ty years , and then it &apos;s done .
it &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own waste dispos@@ al solution .
yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less waste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
and we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today , that &apos;s sitting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ols or dry cas@@ king by re@@ actor .
that &apos;s our fuel to begin with .
so , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ actors is actually what gets f@@ ed into ours , and you &apos;re re@@ duc@@ ing the volume of the waste quite dra@@ ma@@ tically as you &apos;re going through this process .
but in your talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here , where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
well , we haven &apos;t picked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting dis@@ clo@@ sure rules about anything that &apos;s called nuclear , so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in russi@@ a , india , china .
i &apos;ve been back seeing the secre@@ t@@ ary of energy here , talking about how this fits into the energy ag@@ enda .
so i &apos;m optimis@@ tic . you know the french and japanese have done some work .
this is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
it &apos;s an important adv@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a fast re@@ actor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast re@@ actor , is a candi@@ date to be where the first one gets built .
so , in your mind , ti@@ mes@@ cale and lik@@ eli@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
well , we need , for one of these high-@@ scale , elec@@ tro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very cheap , we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to de@@ plo@@ y .
that &apos;s sort of the dea@@ d@@ line that the environmental models have shown us that we have to meet .
and , you know , ter@@ ra@@ power , if things go well , which is w@@ ishing for a lot , could easily meet that .
and there are , fortunately now , do@@ z@@ ens of companies , we need it to be hundreds , who , li@@ ke@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the fun@@ ding for their pil@@ ot plants goes well , that they can com@@ pe@@ te for this .
and it &apos;s best if multiple succe@@ ed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succe@@ ed .
in terms of big@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re aware of out there ?
an energy break@@ through is the most important thing .
it would have been , even without the environmental con@@ str@@ aint , but the environmental con@@ str@@ aint just makes it so much greater .
in the nuclear space , there are other innov@@ ators .
you know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the modu@@ lar people , that &apos;s a different approach .
there &apos;s a liquid type re@@ actor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
and so , there are different ones , but the beauty of this is a molecule of ur@@ an@@ ium has a million times as much energy as a molecule of , say , coal , and so , if you can deal with the neg@@ atives , which are essentially the radiation , the foot@@ print and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and various things , is almost in a class of its own .
if this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
do we have to start taking emer@@ gency mea@@ sures to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable ?
if you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ eating , and you &apos;re about to have a hear@@ t-@@ attack .
then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
there is a line of research on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ engineering , which are various techniques that would del@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
now , that &apos;s just an insur@@ ance policy .
you hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
some people say you shouldn &apos;t even work on the insur@@ ance policy because it might make you la@@ z@@ y , that you &apos;ll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
i &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the importance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ engineering discussion about , should that be in the back po@@ cket in case things happen faster , or this innovation goes a lot s@@ lower than we expect .
climate s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics : if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persu@@ ade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
well , unfortunately , the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics come in different cam@@ ps .
the ones who make scientific argu@@ ments are very few .
are they saying there &apos;s negative feedback effects that have to do with clou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here is kind of like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later -- and a some@@ what un@@ certain pain thing .
in fact , the i@@ p@@ c@@ c report , that &apos;s not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at i@@ p@@ c@@ c and say , okay , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal .
the fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
but my dream here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the co2 con@@ str@@ a@@ ints , then the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tics say , okay , i don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out co2 , i kind of wish it did put out co2 , but i guess i &apos;ll accept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before .
and so , that would be your response to the b@@ j@@ or@@ n l@@ omb@@ or@@ g argument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the co2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other goals of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth , it &apos;s a stupid waste of the earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
well , the actual spending on the r &amp; amp ; d piece -- say the u.s. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ matic .
it shouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ agree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to fund that .
that , to me , mostly is a waste .
unless you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just fun@@ ding the learning curve and it &apos;s going to get very cheap .
i believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less expensive .
if the tra@@ de-@@ off you get into is , let &apos;s make energy super expensive , then the rich can afford that .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifes@@ ty@@ le .
the disaster is for that two billion .
and even l@@ omb@@ or@@ g has changed .
his sh@@ tic@@ k now is , why isn &apos;t the r &amp; amp ; d getting discus@@ sed more .
he &apos;s still , because of his earlier stuff , still associated with the s@@ ke@@ p@@ tic camp , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely camp , and so , he &apos;s making the r &amp; amp ; d point .
and so there is a th@@ read of something that i think is appropriate .
the r &amp; amp ; d piece , it &apos;s crazy how little it &apos;s fun@@ ded .
well bill , i susp@@ ect i speak on the be@@ half of most people here to say , i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
thank you .
so , i &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
i &apos;ve loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate aff@@ air .
it was a beautiful fish , fl@@ av@@ or@@ ful , tex@@ tured , me@@ at@@ y , a b@@ est-@@ sel@@ ler on the men@@ u .
what a fish .
even better , it was farm@@ -@@ raised to the supposed highest standards of sustain@@ ability .
so you could feel good about selling it .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i &apos;d speak at an event about the farm &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
&quot; absolutely , &quot; i said .
here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this un@@ imagin@@ able problem for our chefs .
how do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
for the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been fishing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut for@@ ests .
it &apos;s hard to over@@ state the destruction .
90 percent of large fish , the ones we love , the tun@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mons , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , they &apos;ve collap@@ sed .
there &apos;s almost nothing left .
so , for better or for worse , aqu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish farm@@ ing , is going to be a part of our future .
a lot of argu@@ ments against it .
fish far@@ ms pollu@@ te , most of them do anyway , and they &apos;re in@@ efficient , take tun@@ a .
a major dra@@ w@@ back .
it &apos;s got a feed con@@ version rati@@ o of 15 to one .
that means it takes fif@@ te@@ en pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tun@@ a .
not very sustainable .
doesn &apos;t taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event i called the head of p@@ r for the company .
let &apos;s call him don .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farm@@ ing so far out to sea , you don &apos;t pollu@@ te . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; we &apos;re so far out , the waste from our fish gets distribu@@ ted , not concentr@@ ated . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; we &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
that feed con@@ version rati@@ o ? 2.@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; best in the business . &quot;
2.@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2.@@ 5 to one what ? what are you feeding ? &quot;
&quot; sustainable proteins , &quot; he said .
&quot; great , &quot; i said . got off the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought : what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , &quot; don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
he said he didn &apos;t know . he would ask around .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company .
no one could give me a straight answer .
until finally , i got on the phone with the head biolog@@ ist .
let &apos;s call him don too .
&quot; don , &quot; i said , &quot; what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? &quot;
well , he mentioned some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said chicken p@@ ell@@ ets .
i said , &quot; chicken p@@ ell@@ ets ? &quot;
he said , &quot; yeah , f@@ ea@@ thers , skin , bone m@@ eal , scr@@ aps , dri@@ ed and proc@@ essed into feed . &quot;
i said , &quot; what percentage of your feed is chicken ? &quot;
thinking , you know , two percent .
&quot; well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
i said , &quot; don , what &apos;s sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? &quot;
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , &quot; there &apos;s just too much chicken in the world . &quot;
i fell out of love with this fish .
no , not because i &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , goo@@ dy@@ -@@ two shoes fo@@ o@@ die .
i actually am .
no , i actually fell out of love with this fish because , i sw@@ ear to god , after that conversation , the fish ta@@ sted like chicken .
this second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
it &apos;s the roman@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern sp@@ ain .
a journalis@@ t friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost sh@@ immer@@ ing , white color .
the chef had over@@ coo@@ ked it .
like twice over .
amaz@@ ingly , it was still del@@ icious .
who can make a fish taste good after it &apos;s been over@@ coo@@ ked ?
i can &apos;t , but this guy can .
let &apos;s call him mi@@ gu@@ el .
actually his name is mi@@ gu@@ el .
and no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and he &apos;s not a chef .
at least in the way that you and i understand it .
he &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at vet@@ a la pal@@ ma .
it &apos;s a fish farm in the sou@@ th@@ western corner of sp@@ ain .
it &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
until the 198@@ 0s , the farm was in the hands of the arg@@ ent@@ in@@ i@@ ans .
they raised be@@ ef cat@@ tle on what was essentially w@@ et@@ lands .
they did it by dr@@ aining the land .
they built this in@@ tric@@ ate series of can@@ als , and they push@@ ed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
and eco@@ log@@ ically , it was a disaster .
it killed like 90 percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in 198@@ 2 , a sp@@ an@@ ish company with an environmental conscience pur@@ ch@@ ased the land .
what did they do ?
they re@@ vers@@ ed the flow of water .
they literally fli@@ pped the switch .
instead of push@@ ing water out , they used the ch@@ ann@@ els to pull water back in .
they f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
they created a 2@@ 7@@ ,000 ac@@ re fish farm -- bas@@ s , mul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ mp , e@@ el -- and in the process , mi@@ gu@@ el , and this company , completely re@@ vers@@ ed the eco@@ logical destruction .
the farm &apos;s incredible .
i mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
you st@@ are out at a horizon that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ick , rich mar@@ sh@@ land .
i was there not long ago with mi@@ gu@@ el .
he &apos;s an amazing guy , three parts charles darwin and one part cro@@ co@@ di@@ le dun@@ de@@ e .
okay ? there we are s@@ log@@ ging through the w@@ et@@ lands , and i &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and mi@@ gu@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly condu@@ c@@ ting a biology lecture .
here , he &apos;s point@@ ing out a rare black@@ -@@ shoul@@ der@@ ed k@@ ite .
now , he &apos;s menti@@ oning the min@@ er@@ al needs of ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton .
and here , here he sees a grou@@ ping pattern that re@@ minds him of the tanzan@@ ian gi@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
it turns out , mi@@ gu@@ el spent the better part of his career in the mi@@ ku@@ mi national park in africa .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
he said , &quot; fish ? i didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
i &apos;m an expert in relationships . &quot;
and then he &apos;s off laun@@ ching into more talk about rare birds and al@@ ga@@ es and strange aqu@@ atic plants .
and don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fascinating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ plu@@ gg@@ ed , kind of thing .
it &apos;s great , but i was in love .
and my head was s@@ wo@@ oning over that over@@ coo@@ ked piece of del@@ icious fish i had the night before .
so i inter@@ rup@@ ted him . i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , what makes your fish taste so good ? &quot;
he point@@ ed at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; i know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , the relationships , it &apos;s amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
what &apos;s the feed con@@ version rati@@ o ? &quot;
well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system , that the fish are eating what they &apos;d be eating in the wild .
the plant biom@@ ass , the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ o@@ plan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ eds the fish .
the system is so healthy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ ren@@ e@@ wing .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals ?
later that day , i was driving around this property with mi@@ gu@@ el , and i asked him , i said , &quot; for a place that seems so natural , &quot; unlike like any farm i &apos;d ever been at , &quot; how do you measure success ? &quot;
at that moment , it was as if a film director called for a set change .
and we r@@ ounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight , thousands and thousands of pin@@ k fl@@ amin@@ gos , a liter@@ al pin@@ k car@@ pet for as far as you could see .
&quot; that &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; look at their bel@@ lies , pin@@ k .
they &apos;re f@@ ea@@ sting . &quot;
f@@ ea@@ sting ? i was totally conf@@ used .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , aren &apos;t they f@@ ea@@ sting on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; we lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to birds .
well , last year , this property had 6@@ 00,000 birds on it , more than 250 different species .
it &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private bird s@@ anc@@ tu@@ aries in all of europe . &quot;
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , isn &apos;t a th@@ ri@@ ving bird population like the last thing you want on a fish farm ? &quot;
he sho@@ ok his head , no .
he said , &quot; we farm ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vely , not inten@@ si@@ vely .
this is an eco@@ logical network .
the fl@@ amin@@ gos eat the sh@@ ri@@ mp .
the sh@@ ri@@ mp eat the ph@@ y@@ to@@ plan@@ k@@ ton .
so the pin@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view .
a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , and a farm that mea@@ sures its success on the health of its predat@@ ors .
a fish farm , but also a bird s@@ anc@@ tu@@ ary .
oh , and by the way , those fl@@ amin@@ gos , they shouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
they bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nes@@ ts .
every morning , they fly 150 miles into the farm .
and every ev@@ ening , they fly 150 miles back .
they do that because they &apos;re able to follow the broken white line of high@@ way a@@ 9@@ 2 .
no kid@@ ding .
i was imagin@@ ing a mar@@ ch of the penguins thing , so i looked at mi@@ gu@@ el .
i said , &quot; mi@@ gu@@ el , do they fly 150 miles to the farm , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? &quot;
he looked at me like i had just quot@@ ed a whit@@ ney hou@@ ston song .
he said , &quot; no . they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
i didn &apos;t mention the skin of my bel@@ o@@ ved fish , which was del@@ icious , and i don &apos;t like fish skin .
i don &apos;t like it sear@@ ed . i don &apos;t like it cris@@ p@@ y .
it &apos;s that ac@@ rid , tar@@ -@@ like fl@@ av@@ or .
i almost never co@@ ok with it .
yet , when i ta@@ sted it at that restaurant in southern sp@@ ain , it ta@@ sted not at all like fish skin .
it ta@@ sted sweet and clean like you were taking a b@@ ite of the ocean .
i mentioned that to mi@@ gu@@ el , and he no@@ dded .
he said , &quot; the skin acts like a spon@@ ge .
it &apos;s the last defen@@ se before anything ent@@ ers the body .
it evolved to so@@ ak up im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
and then he added , &quot; but our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
okay . a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its fish .
a farm that mea@@ sures its success by the success of its predat@@ ors .
and then i realized when he says , a farm that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , he made a big underst@@ atement , because the water that flo@@ ws through that farm comes in from the gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r river .
it &apos;s a river that car@@ ries with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to carry these days , chemical cont@@ amin@@ ants , p@@ esti@@ cide ru@@ no@@ ff .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is clean@@ er than when it ent@@ ered .
the system is so healthy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn &apos;t feed its animals , not just a farm that mea@@ sures its success by the health of its predat@@ ors , but a farm that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fication plant , and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
because when that water leaves , it du@@ mps out into the atlan@@ tic .
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , however roman@@ tic , is also instruc@@ tive .
you might say it &apos;s a reci@@ pe for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about bas@@ s or be@@ ef cat@@ tle .
what we need now is a radi@@ cally new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually ta@@ stes good .
but for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radical .
we &apos;re not re@@ alis@@ ts , us fo@@ o@@ dies .
we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
we love farmers &apos; markets .
we love small family far@@ ms .
we talk about local food .
we eat organic .
and when you suggest these are the things that will in@@ sure the future of good food , someone somewhere st@@ ands up and says , &quot; hey guy , i love pin@@ k fl@@ amin@@ gos , but how are you going to feed the world ? &quot;
how are you going to feed the world ?
can i be honest ?
i don &apos;t love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hun@@ gry today .
one billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gro@@ ss ine@@ quali@@ ties in distribution , not t@@ onn@@ age .
no , i don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s deter@@ min@@ ed the logic of our food system for the last 50 years .
feed grain to her@@ bi@@ v@@ or@@ es , p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des to mono@@ cultures , chemicals to soil , chicken to fish , and all along agri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; if we &apos;re feeding more people more chea@@ ply , how terrible could that be ? &quot;
that &apos;s been the motivation , it &apos;s been the justi@@ fication , it &apos;s been the business plan of american agriculture .
we should call it what it is , a business in li@@ qu@@ id@@ ation , a business that &apos;s quickly ero@@ ding eco@@ logical capital that makes that very production possible .
that &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t agriculture .
our bread bas@@ k@@ et is thre@@ at@@ ened today , not because of dimin@@ ishing supply , but because of dimin@@ ishing resources .
not by the lat@@ est combine and tr@@ actor invention , but by ferti@@ le land ; not by pu@@ mps , but by fresh water ; not by ch@@ ain@@ sa@@ ws , but by for@@ ests ; and not by fishing bo@@ ats and nets , but by fish in the sea .
want to feed the world ?
let &apos;s start by asking : how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better , how can we create conditions that en@@ able every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don &apos;t look at the agri@@ business model for the future .
it &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
it &apos;s high on capital , chemistry , and machines , and it &apos;s never produced anything really good to eat .
instead , let &apos;s look to the eco@@ logical model .
that &apos;s the one that reli@@ es on two billion years of on-@@ the-@@ job experience .
look to mi@@ gu@@ el -- farmers like mi@@ gu@@ el .
far@@ ms that aren &apos;t worlds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that res@@ to@@ re instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; far@@ ms that farm ex@@ ten@@ si@@ vely instead of just inten@@ si@@ vely ; farmers that are not just produc@@ ers , but experts in relationships .
because they &apos;re the ones that are experts in fl@@ av@@ or too .
and if i &apos;m going to be really honest , they &apos;re a better chef than i &apos;ll ever be .
you know , i &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be del@@ icious .
thank you .
i grew up on a stea@@ dy diet of science fiction .
in high school i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and i was always absor@@ bed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satis@@ fied , in a narr@@ ative form , this ins@@ ati@@ able sense of curios@@ ity that i had .
and you know that curios@@ ity also manifes@@ ted itself in the fact that whenever i wasn &apos;t in school i was out in the wo@@ ods , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples , &quot; fro@@ gs and s@@ na@@ kes and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water , and bringing it back , looking at it under the microscope .
you know , i was a real science ge@@ ek .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the lim@@ its of possibility .
and my love of science fiction actually seemed to mir@@ ro@@ red in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 60s , we were going to the moon , we were explor@@ ing the deep oceans .
jac@@ ques cou@@ st@@ eau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a won@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have previ@@ ously imagin@@ ed .
so , that seemed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fiction part of it .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this satur@@ ation of c@@ g movies and all of this imag@@ ery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the auth@@ or &apos;s description put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw ali@@ en creatures , ali@@ en worlds , robots , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
i was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ sted in math class do@@ od@@ ling behind the t@@ ext@@ book .
that was , the creativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
and an interesting thing happened , the jac@@ ques cou@@ st@@ eau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an ali@@ en world right here on earth .
i might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day .
that seemed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
but that was a world i could really go to , right here on earth , that was as rich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that i had imagin@@ ed from reading these books .
so , i decided i was going to become a s@@ cu@@ ba di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , 600 miles from the near@@ est ocean .
but i didn &apos;t let that dau@@ n@@ t me .
i pes@@ tered my father until he finally found a s@@ cu@@ ba class in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
and i actually got certi@@ fied in a po@@ ol in a ym@@ ca in the dead of winter in bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , new york .
and i didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 40 years , i &apos;ve spent about 3,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of that was in submer@@ si@@ bles .
and i &apos;ve learned that that deep ocean environment , and even the sh@@ allow oceans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imagination .
nature &apos;s imagination is so boun@@ d@@ less compared to our own me@@ ager human imagination .
i still , to this day , stand in absolute a@@ we of what i see when i make these di@@ ves .
and my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
but , when i chose a career , as an adult , it was film making .
and that seemed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge i had to tell stories , with my ur@@ ges to create images .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing com@@ ic books , and so on .
so , film making was the way to put pictures and stories together . and that made sense .
and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories : &quot; termin@@ ator , &quot; &quot; ali@@ ens , &quot; and &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss . &quot;
and with &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; i was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving , with film making .
so , you know , mer@@ ging the two pas@@ sions .
something interesting came out of &quot; the ab@@ y@@ ss , &quot; which was that to solve a specific narr@@ ative problem on that film , which was to create this kind of liquid water creature , we actually embr@@ ac@@ ed computer gener@@ ated animation , c@@ g .
and this resul@@ ted in the first sof@@ t-@@ surface character , c@@ g animation that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn &apos;t make any money , bar@@ ely broke even , i should say , i wit@@ n@@ essed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mes@@ mer@@ ized by this appar@@ ent magic .
you know , it &apos;s ar@@ thu@@ r clar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suff@@ ici@@ ently advanced technology is in@@ distin@@ gu@@ ish@@ able from magic .
they were seeing something magi@@ cal .
and so that got me very excited .
and i thought , &quot; wow , this is something that needs to be embr@@ ac@@ ed into the cin@@ em@@ atic art . &quot;
so , with &quot; termin@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
working with il@@ m , we created the liquid metal du@@ de in that fil@@ m. the success hun@@ g in the balance on whether that effect would work .
and it did . and we created magic again .
and we had the same result with an audience .
although we did make a little more money on that one .
so , drawing a line through those two dots of experience , came to , this is going to be a whole new world , this was a whole new world of creativity for film artists .
so , i started a company with st@@ an w@@ inst@@ on , my good friend st@@ an w@@ inst@@ on , who is the premier ma@@ ke@@ -up and creature designer at that time , and it was called digital dom@@ ain .
and the concept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ -@@ fro@@ g past the analo@@ g processes of op@@ tical print@@ ers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competi@@ tive advantage for a while .
but we found ourselves l@@ ag@@ ging in the mi@@ d &apos; 9@@ 0s in the creature and character design stuff that we had actually foun@@ ded the company to do .
so , i wrote this piece called &quot; av@@ atar , &quot; which was meant to absolutely push the envelop@@ e of visual effects , of c@@ g effects , beyond , with re@@ alistic human emo@@ tive characters gener@@ ated in c@@ g and the main characters would all be in c@@ g and the world would be in c@@ g and the envelop@@ e push@@ ed back .
and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
so , i shel@@ ved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
you know , i went and pit@@ ched it to the studio as &quot; &apos; rom@@ e@@ o and juli@@ et &apos; on a ship . &quot;
it &apos;s going to be this epi@@ c rom@@ ance , passionate film .
secre@@ tly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ rec@@ k of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic . &quot;
and that &apos;s why i made the movie .
and that &apos;s the truth . now , the studio didn &apos;t know that .
but i convinced them . i said , &quot; we &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ rec@@ k . we &apos;re going to film it for real .
we &apos;ll be using it in the opening of the film .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing ho@@ ok . &quot;
and i talked them into fun@@ ding an ex@@ pe@@ dition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about about your imagination creating a reality .
because we actually created a reality where six months later i find myself in a russi@@ an submer@@ sible two and a half miles down in the north atlan@@ tic , looking at the real ti@@ tan@@ ic through a view port , not a movie , not h@@ d , for real .
now , that ble@@ w my mind .
and it took a lot of prepar@@ ation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
but , it stru@@ ck me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves was like a space mission .
you know , where it was highly technical , and it requi@@ red enormous planning .
you get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark hosti@@ le environment where there is no hope of res@@ cue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
and i thought like , &quot; wow . i am like living in a science fiction movie .
this is really cool . &quot;
and so , i really got bit@@ ten by the bu@@ g of deep ocean exploration .
of course , the curios@@ ity , the science compon@@ ent of it .
it was everything . it was adv@@ enture , it was curios@@ ity . it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn &apos;t give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn &apos;t imagine what i was seeing out that window .
as we did some of our sub@@ se@@ quent ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions i was seeing creatures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that i had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not described by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them .
so , i was completely sm@@ it@@ ten by this , and had to do more .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
after the success of &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic , &quot; i said , &quot; okay , i &apos;m going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker , and i &apos;m going to go be a full time explorer for a while . &quot;
and so , we started planning these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions .
and we w@@ ound up going to the bis@@ mark , and explor@@ ing it with robo@@ tic vehic@@ les .
we went back to the ti@@ tan@@ ic w@@ rec@@ k .
we took little b@@ ots that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
and the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ ior surve@@ y of that ship , which had never been done .
nobody had ever looked inside the w@@ rec@@ k . they didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
so , you know , here i am now , on the dec@@ k of ti@@ tan@@ ic , sitting in a submer@@ sible , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where i knew that the band had played .
and i &apos;m flying a little robo@@ tic vehicle through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
when i say , i &apos;m operating it , but my mind is in the vehicle .
i felt like i was physi@@ cally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ k of ti@@ tan@@ ic .
and it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja vu experience i &apos;ve ever had , because i would know before i turned a corner what was going to be there before the lights of the vehicle actually reve@@ al@@ ed it , because i had walked the set for months when we were making the movie .
and the set was based as an exact repli@@ ca on the blu@@ e@@ print@@ s of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the tele@@ pres@@ en@@ se experience that you actually can have these robo@@ tic av@@ at@@ ars , then your consciousness is inj@@ ected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really really quite profound .
and may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some decades out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bodies for exploration or for other means in many sort of post-@@ human fu@@ tures that i can imagine , as a science fiction fan .
so , having done these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions , and really beginning to appreci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing amazing animals .
they are basically ali@@ ens right here on earth .
they live in an environment of chem@@ o@@ syn@@ thesis .
they don &apos;t survive on sunlight based system the way we do .
and so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to a 500 degree centi@@ grade water plu@@ mes .
you think they can &apos;t possibly exist .
at the same time i was getting very interested in space science as well , again , it &apos;s the science fiction influence , as a kid .
and i w@@ ound up getting involved with the space community , really involved with nasa , sitting on the nasa ad@@ vis@@ ory board , planning actual space mis@@ sions , going to russi@@ a , going to the pre-@@ cos@@ mon@@ aut biom@@ edi@@ cal proto@@ col@@ s , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the international space station with our 3d camera systems .
and this was fascinating .
but what i w@@ ound up doing was bringing space scientists with us into the deep .
and taking them down so that they had access as@@ tro@@ biolog@@ ists , plan@@ et@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extreme environments , taking them down to the v@@ ents , and l@@ etting them see , and take sam@@ ples and test instruments , and so on .
so , here we were making document@@ ary films , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
i &apos;d completely closed the loo@@ p between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
i learned a lot about science . but i also learned a lot about leadership .
now you think director has got to be a leader , leader of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
i didn &apos;t really learn about leadership until i did these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; what am i doing out here ?
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? &quot;
we don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n shows .
we bar@@ ely break even . there is no fa@@ me in it .
people sort of think i went away between &quot; ti@@ tan@@ ic &quot; and &quot; av@@ atar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ ails some@@ place , sitting at the beach .
made all these films , made all these document@@ ary films for a very limited audience .
no fa@@ me , no gl@@ ory , no money . what are you doing ?
you &apos;re doing it for the task itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challeng@@ ing environment there is , for the thr@@ ill of discovery , and for that strange bond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ ghtly k@@ n@@ it team .
because we would do these things with 10@@ -@@ 12 people working for years at a time .
sometimes at sea for 2@@ -@@ 3 months at a time .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a task that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
when you come back to the sho@@ re and you say , &quot; we had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the att@@ entu@@ ation , and the this and that , all the technology of it , and the difficul@@ ty , the human performance aspects of working at sea , you can &apos;t explain it to people . it &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in combat that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
so , when i came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; av@@ atar , &quot; i tried to apply that same principle of leadership which is that you respect your team , and you ear@@ n their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here i was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted territ@@ ory doing &quot; av@@ atar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t exist before .
tremend@@ ously exciting .
tremend@@ ously challeng@@ ing .
and we became a family , over a four and half year period .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
so , people have comment@@ ed on how , well , you know , you brought back the ocean organisms and put them on the planet of pand@@ or@@ a .
to me it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
so , what can we syn@@ thes@@ ize out of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
well , i think number one is curios@@ ity .
it &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually manif@@ est a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world .
i have young film makers come up to me and say , &quot; give me some ad@@ vice for doing this . &quot;
and i say , &quot; don &apos;t put limit@@ ations on yourself .
other people will do that for you , don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t bet against yourself .
and take risks . &quot;
nasa has this phrase that they like : &quot; failure is not an option . &quot;
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of faith .
and no important end@@ e@@ av@@ or that requi@@ red innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , that &apos;s the thought i would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
if i can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is greater that the sum of the parts , and , instead of thinking about information over@@ load , what i &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns pop and we can see tr@@ ends that would otherwise be invisible .
so what we &apos;re looking at right here is a typical mortality char@@ t organized by age .
this tool that i &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
it &apos;s called pi@@ vo@@ t , and with pi@@ vo@@ t what i can do is i can choose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of dea@@ ths , say accidents .
and , right away , i see there &apos;s a different pattern that emerg@@ es .
this is because , in the mi@@ d-@@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most f@@ rai@@ l .
we can step back out again and then re@@ organiz@@ e the data by cause of death , seeing that circul@@ atory diseases and cancer are the usual su@@ spec@@ ts , but not for everyone .
if we go ahead and we fil@@ ter by age , say 40 years or less , we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if you dr@@ ill into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
so you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like swimming in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ graphi@@ c .
and if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here , is the cover of every single s@@ ports illustr@@ ated ever produced .
it &apos;s all here . it &apos;s all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
with pi@@ vo@@ t , you can dr@@ ill into a decade .
you can dr@@ ill into a particular year .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
so i &apos;m looking at this ; i see the ath@@ let@@ es that have appeared in this issue , the s@@ ports .
i &apos;m a l@@ ance arm@@ strong fan , so i &apos;ll go ahead and i &apos;ll click on that , which reve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which l@@ ance arm@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
now , if i want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , i might think , &quot; well , what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
so i can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
and i see gre@@ g lem@@ ond now .
and so you get the idea that when you navig@@ ate over information this way , going nar@@ ro@@ wer , broad@@ er , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out , you &apos;re not se@@ arch@@ ing , you &apos;re not brow@@ sing .
you &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
it &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to extra@@ pol@@ ate on this idea a bit something that &apos;s a little bit crazy .
what we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single wikipedia page and re@@ duced it down to a little sum@@ mary .
so the sum@@ mary cons@@ is@@ ted of just little sy@@ no@@ p@@ sis and an ic@@ on to indi@@ cate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
i &apos;m only showing the top 500 most popular wikipedia pages right here .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ ains that are most popular on wikipedia .
i &apos;m going to go ahead and sel@@ ect government .
now , having sel@@ ected government , i can now see that the wikipedia categ@@ ories that most frequ@@ ently correspond to that are time magazine people of the year .
so this is really important because this is an insi@@ ght that was not con@@ ta@@ ined within any one wikipedia page .
it &apos;s only possible to see that insi@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular sum@@ mar@@ ies , i can then dr@@ ill into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
so looking at these people , i can see that the majority come from government .
some have come from natural sciences .
some , fewer still , have come from business .
there &apos;s my bo@@ ss .
and one has come from music .
and interes@@ t@@ ingly enough , bon@@ o is also a ted prize win@@ ner .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize win@@ ners .
so you see , we &apos;re navig@@ ating the web for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a web , not page to page , but at a higher level of abstr@@ action .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
i &apos;m just showing the new york times website here .
so pi@@ vo@@ t , this application -- i don &apos;t want to call it a brow@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a brow@@ ser , but you can view web pages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ able technology to every single web page like this .
so i can step back , pop right back in to a specific section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtu@@ e of just vie@@ wing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire brow@@ sing history in the exact same way .
so i can dr@@ ill in to what i &apos;ve done over specific time fram@@ es .
here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that i just gave .
and i can sort of re@@ play some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
and , if i want to step back and look at everything , i can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my history perhaps by my search history .
here , i was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ stic se@@ arch@@ ing , looking for bing , over here for live lab@@ s pi@@ vo@@ t .
and from these , i can dr@@ ill into the web page and just laun@@ ch them again .
it &apos;s one metaphor re@@ pur@@ posed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
we talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ load .
we talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
what if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the web up@@ side down , so that instead of one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
if we can do that , then , instead of being tr@@ apped in data , we might actually extr@@ act information .
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tea@@ se out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wisdom to be found .
so with that , i thank you .
let &apos;s pre@@ tend right here we have a machine , a big machine , a cool , te@@ d-@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
and i wonder what you &apos;d choose , because i &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately , and they all want to go back .
i don &apos;t know . they want to go back before there were automobi@@ les or twitter or &quot; american i@@ do@@ l . &quot;
i don &apos;t know .
i &apos;m convinced that there &apos;s some sort of pull to no@@ st@@ al@@ gi@@ a , to w@@ ish@@ ful thinking .
and i understand that .
i &apos;m not part of that crowd , i have to say .
i don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because i &apos;m adv@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous -- it &apos;s because possibilities on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
this is the greatest time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure you wish to choose : health , wealth , mo@@ bility , opportunity , dec@@ lin@@ ing rates of disease .
there &apos;s never been a time like this .
my great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
my grand@@ parents push@@ ed that number to 70 .
my parents are clo@@ sing in on 80 .
so there had better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
but it &apos;s not even about people like us because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the rich@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
think about that . it &apos;s an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
small@@ po@@ x . small@@ po@@ x killed billions of people on this planet .
it res@@ hap@@ ed the dem@@ ograp@@ hy of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
it &apos;s gone . it &apos;s van@@ ished .
we van@@ qu@@ ished it . pu@@ ff .
in the rich world , diseases that thre@@ at@@ ened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , har@@ dly .
di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a , ru@@ bel@@ la , polio ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vacc@@ ines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific method .
and to my mind , the scientific method , trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t , is one of the great accompli@@ sh@@ ments of humanity .
so that &apos;s the good news .
unfortunately , that &apos;s all the good news because there &apos;s some other problems , and they &apos;ve been mentioned many times , and one of them is that , despite all our accompli@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed hun@@ gry in this world , every day .
that number &apos;s ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing really rapidly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful .
and not only that , we &apos;ve used our imagination to th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly tr@@ ash this globe .
po@@ table water , ar@@ able land , rain@@ for@@ ests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and unless we innov@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess , we &apos;re going away too .
so the question is : can we do that ? i think we can .
i think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also destro@@ y it .
i really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t w@@ ish@@ ful thinking .
but here &apos;s the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeps me up at night .
we &apos;ve never needed progress in science more than we need it right now , never , and we &apos;ve also never been in a position to de@@ plo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
we &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing events in many fields .
and yet , i actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the en@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we batt@@ led progress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ gor@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
people w@@ ra@@ p themselves in their beli@@ efs , and they do it so ti@@ ghtly that you can &apos;t set them free .
not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone &apos;s enti@@ tled to their opinion ; they &apos;re even enti@@ tled to their opinion about progress , but you know what you &apos;re not enti@@ tled to ?
you &apos;re not enti@@ tled to your own facts . sorry , you &apos;re not .
and this took me a@@ while to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vacc@@ ines for &quot; the new yor@@ ker , &quot; a little story .
and i was ama@@ zed to find op@@ position , op@@ position to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn &apos;t know what to do , so i just did what i do , i wrote a story and i moved on .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
so i wrote a story about that too , and i couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; fran@@ ken@@ fo@@ ods , &quot; why they thought moving molecules around in a specific , rather than a hap@@ h@@ az@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ing on nature &apos;s ground .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
i mean , i &apos;m a journalis@@ t ; we type , we file , we go to dinner , it &apos;s fine .
but these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and i couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually i did .
and that &apos;s because those f@@ an@@ ati@@ cs that were driving me crazy weren &apos;t actually f@@ an@@ ati@@ cs at all .
they were thou@@ ght@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , dec@@ ent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just dis@@ tur@@ bed me so much ...
but then i thought , you know , let &apos;s be honest : we &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it ambi@@ val@@ ently .
we talk about it in iron@@ ic terms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; progress . &quot;
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we &apos;ve lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we shouldn &apos;t have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
cher@@ no@@ by@@ l , b@@ hop@@ al , the challeng@@ er , vi@@ ox@@ x , weapons of mass destruction , hang@@ ing cha@@ ds .
i mean , you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right .
so be s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical .
ask questions , demand pro@@ of , demand evidence .
don &apos;t take anything for gran@@ ted .
but here &apos;s the thing : when you get pro@@ of , you need to accept the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
and the reason i can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epidemic of fear like one i &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
about 12 years ago , there was a story published , a horrible story , that linked the epidemic of au@@ tis@@ m to the me@@ as@@ les , mu@@ mps , and ru@@ bel@@ la vaccine shot .
very scar@@ y .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from swe@@ den , from canada , and it was all the same , no cor@@ relation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn &apos;t matter . i doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ otes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
we don &apos;t believe a bunch of documents from a government offici@@ al giving us data , and i do understand that , i think we all do .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been dis@@ as@@ trous , dis@@ as@@ trous because here &apos;s a fact : the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for me@@ as@@ les is going down .
that is dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful , and we should be ash@@ am@@ ed of ourselves .
it &apos;s horrible .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that .
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
because , does anyone have me@@ as@@ les here ?
has one person in this audience ever see someone die of me@@ as@@ les ?
doesn &apos;t happen very much .
doesn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 16@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
that &apos;s a lot of death of me@@ as@@ les , 20 an hour .
but since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like j@@ en@@ ny mc@@ car@@ thy can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing messages of fear and illi@@ ter@@ acy from plat@@ forms like o@@ pr@@ ah and larry king live .
and they can do it because they don &apos;t link caus@@ ation and cor@@ relation .
they don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
and it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a hero , jon@@ as sal@@ k .
he took one of the worst s@@ cour@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
no fear , no ag@@ on@@ y , polio , pu@@ ff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul off@@ it .
he just developed a rot@@ av@@ ir@@ us vaccine with a bunch of other people .
it &apos;s save the lives of 400 , 5@@ 00,000 kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it &apos;s good , except that paul goes around talking about vacc@@ ines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ in@@ ing .
and he actually says it that way .
so , paul &apos;s a terror@@ ist .
when paul spea@@ ks in a public hearing , he can &apos;t t@@ esti@@ fy without arm@@ ed gu@@ ards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don &apos;t need to say this , but vacc@@ ines are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases , and that &apos;s happening we have me@@ as@@ les in this country now .
and it &apos;s getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
and they &apos;re not just going to die of me@@ as@@ les .
what about polio ? let &apos;s have that . why not ?
a college class@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought i was a little str@@ ident .
no one &apos;s ever said that before .
she wasn &apos;t going to vaccin@@ ate her kid against polio .
no way .
fine .
why ? because we don &apos;t have polio . and you know what ?
we didn &apos;t have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in l@@ agos this morning , and he &apos;s flying to la@@ x , right now he &apos;s over o@@ hi@@ o .
and he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to rent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to long beach , and he &apos;s going to attend one of these fabul@@ ous ted din@@ ners ton@@ ight .
and he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s infected with a paraly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
that &apos;s the planet we live on . don &apos;t pre@@ tend it isn &apos;t .
now , we love to w@@ ra@@ p ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vit@@ am@@ ins this morning ?
e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ ox@@ id@@ ant to get you going .
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medi@@ c@@ ines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
the data says it all the time .
they dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . they almost never do more than that .
it &apos;s okay , you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine , i &apos;m totally with you .
dark ur@@ ine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand , we hate big ph@@ ar@@ ma .
we hate big government . we don &apos;t trust the man .
and we shouldn &apos;t . our health care system suc@@ ks .
it &apos;s cru@@ el to millions of people .
it &apos;s absolutely aston@@ ish@@ ingly cold and sou@@ l-@@ b@@ ending to those of us who can even afford it .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we lea@@ p into the arms of big plac@@ e@@ bo .
that &apos;s fantastic . i love big plac@@ e@@ bo .
but , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is cr@@ ap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
none of it -- gin@@ k@@ go , fr@@ au@@ d , e@@ chin@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fr@@ au@@ d , ac@@ ai , i don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re spending billions of dollars on it , it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . &quot;
and you know what ? you &apos;re wrong .
because i don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the secre@@ t@@ ary of h@@ .@@ h@@ .@@ s .
who &apos;s saying , &quot; h@@ mm , i &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my experts on mammo@@ gr@@ ams , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to treat his patient with coffee enem@@ as .
when you start down the road where belief and magic re@@ place evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
you end up in th@@ ab@@ o m@@ be@@ ki south africa .
he killed 4@@ 00,000 of his people by ins@@ is@@ ting that bee@@ tro@@ ot gar@@ lic and lem@@ on oil were much more effective than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ viral drugs we know can slow the course of aids .
hundreds of thousands of need@@ less dea@@ ths in a country that has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed worse than any other by this disease .
please , don &apos;t tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
now , the most min@@ d@@ less epidemic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d bat@@ tle between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food and the organic el@@ ite .
it &apos;s an idi@@ o@@ tic debate . it has to stop .
it &apos;s a debate about words , about met@@ ap@@ hors .
it &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
every single thing we eat , every grain of rice , every s@@ pri@@ g of par@@ s@@ ley , every br@@ us@@ sel spr@@ out has been modi@@ fied by man .
you know , there weren &apos;t t@@ anger@@ ines in the garden of ed@@ en .
there wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ pe .
there weren &apos;t christ@@ mas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last 1@@ 1,000 years .
and some of it worked and some of it didn &apos;t .
we got rid of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
now we can do it in a more pre@@ cise way .
and there are risks , absolutely .
but we can put something like vit@@ am@@ in a into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
you don &apos;t want to do that ?
i have to say , i don &apos;t understand it .
we object to gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
why do we do that ?
well , the things i constantly hear are : too many chemicals , p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mono@@ culture , we don &apos;t want giant fields of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
we don &apos;t companies pat@@ ent@@ ing life .
we don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning see@@ ds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you &apos;re right . let &apos;s fix it .
it &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
this has nothing to do with science .
it &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s pat@@ ent stuff .
you know science isn &apos;t a company .
it &apos;s not a country .
it &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
it &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re afraid , is really very dea@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s prev@@ ent@@ ing millions of people from pros@@ per@@ ing .
you know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
this investment in africa over the last 30 years .
dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful . dis@@ gr@@ ac@@ eful .
they need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
and why ? gene@@ tically engine@@ ered food .
we don &apos;t want to encourage people to eat that rot@@ ten stuff , like cass@@ av@@ a for instance .
cass@@ av@@ a &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
it &apos;s kind of like a po@@ ta@@ to .
it &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . it suc@@ ks .
it doesn &apos;t have nutri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go blind .
they wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn &apos;t be chez pan@@ isse , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is : why are we fighting it ?
i mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : why are we fighting it ?
because we don &apos;t want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it &apos;s not about chemicals .
it &apos;s not about our ridi@@ cul@@ ous passion for hor@@ mon@@ es , our ins@@ ist@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sin@@ gu@@ lar food .
this isn &apos;t about rice k@@ ris@@ pi@@ es , this is about keeping people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that meant .
because , you know something ?
if we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re acting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that i don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of , high-@@ tech colon@@ i@@ alism .
there &apos;s no other way to describe what &apos;s going on here .
it &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s ug@@ ly , it &apos;s bene@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amaz@@ ingly fun conversation , you might want to say , &quot; so , you still want to get in this ridi@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
it &apos;s stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these conversations , and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
i know that we can , and , as far as i &apos;m concerned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
one day los angeles times colum@@ n@@ ist steve lo@@ p@@ ez was walking along the streets of down@@ town los angeles when he heard beautiful music .
and the source was a man , an afri@@ can@@ -@@ american man , char@@ ming , ru@@ gg@@ ed , hom@@ eless , playing a vi@@ o@@ lin that only had two str@@ ings .
and i &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because steve &apos;s colum@@ ns became the basis for a book , which was turned into a movie , with robert do@@ w@@ ney j@@ r acting as steve lo@@ p@@ ez , and jam@@ ie fo@@ x@@ x as na@@ than@@ iel an@@ th@@ on@@ y ay@@ ers , the ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained double bass@@ ist whose promis@@ ing career was cut short by a trag@@ ic aff@@ li@@ ction with par@@ an@@ o@@ id sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ia .
na@@ than@@ iel dro@@ pped out of ju@@ illi@@ ard , he suff@@ ered a complete break@@ down , and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless on the streets of s@@ kid row in down@@ town los angeles .
i encourage all of you to read steve &apos;s book , or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful bond that formed between these two men , but how music helped shape that bond , and ultimately was instru@@ mental , if you &apos;ll par@@ don the p@@ un , in helping na@@ than@@ iel get off the streets .
i met mr. ay@@ ers in 2008 , two years ago , at wal@@ t dis@@ ney concert hall .
he had just heard a performance of bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s first and fourth sym@@ phon@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and introduced himself .
he was speaking in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ gar@@ i@@ ous way about y@@ o-@@ yo ma and h@@ ill@@ ary cl@@ int@@ on , and how the do@@ d@@ gers were never going to make the world series , all because of the tre@@ a@@ cher@@ ous first vi@@ o@@ lin passage work in the last movement in bee@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s fourth sym@@ phon@@ y .
and we got talking about music . and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that na@@ than@@ iel was interested in a vi@@ o@@ lin lesson with me .
now , i should mention that na@@ than@@ iel re@@ f@@ uses treatment because when he was treated it was with sho@@ ck therapy and th@@ or@@ az@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , and that s@@ car has st@@ ayed with him for his entire life .
but , as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these sch@@ iz@@ oph@@ ren@@ ic ep@@ is@@ odes .
the worst of which can manif@@ est themselves as him explo@@ ding , and then dis@@ appear@@ ing for days , wan@@ der@@ ing the streets of s@@ kid row , ex@@ posed to its hor@@ rors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed upon him .
and na@@ than@@ iel was in such a state of ag@@ itation when we started our first lesson at wal@@ t dis@@ ney concert hall he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
and he was talking about invisible dem@@ ons and smo@@ ke , and how someone was pois@@ oning him in his sleep .
and i was afraid , not for myself , but i was afraid that i was going to lose him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his states , and that i would ru@@ in his relationship with the vi@@ o@@ lin if i started talking about s@@ cales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vi@@ o@@ lin pe@@ d@@ ag@@ o@@ g@@ y .
so , i just started playing .
and i played the first movement of the bee@@ tho@@ ven vi@@ o@@ lin concer@@ to .
and as i played i understood that there was a profound change occur@@ ring in na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s eyes .
it was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some invisible pharmaceu@@ tical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
and na@@ than@@ iel &apos;s man@@ ic rage was transform@@ ed into understanding , a quiet curios@@ ity , and gr@@ ace .
and in a miracle , he lif@@ ted his own vi@@ o@@ lin , and he started playing , by ear , certain s@@ ni@@ pp@@ ets of vi@@ o@@ lin concer@@ to@@ s which he then asked me to complete , m@@ end@@ el@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n , t@@ ch@@ ai@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , si@@ beli@@ us .
and we started talking about music , from b@@ ach to bee@@ tho@@ ven , and br@@ ah@@ ms , bru@@ ck@@ ner , all the b &apos;s , from bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to es@@ a-@@ pe@@ k@@ ka sal@@ on@@ en .
and i understood that he not only had an encyclo@@ pe@@ di@@ c knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles phil@@ harmon@@ ic .
and through playing music and talking about music this man had transform@@ ed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , dis@@ tur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the streets of down@@ town los angeles , to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ d@@ ite , brilliant , ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ trained musici@@ an .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music is san@@ ity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and del@@ u@@ sions , and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and that is an es@@ cape from his tor@@ ment@@ ed state .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us , at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our arti@@ stic l@@ ens , through our creativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression re@@ aches all of us , and moves us , insp@@ ires and un@@ ites us .
and for na@@ than@@ iel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
the red@@ emp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of musici@@ ans that understood him , that recogni@@ zed his talents and resp@@ ected him .
and i will always make music with na@@ than@@ iel , whether we &apos;re at wal@@ t dis@@ ney concert hall , or on s@@ kid row , because he re@@ minds me why i became a musici@@ an .
thank you .
thank you . thanks .

i want to play something that i sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly sto@@ le from cel@@ li@@ sts .
so , please for@@ give me .
several years ago , here at ted , peter sk@@ ill@@ man introduced a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
and the idea &apos;s pretty simple .
te@@ ams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 sti@@ cks of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti , one y@@ ard of tape , one y@@ ard of string and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard , because it forces people to collabor@@ ate very quickly .
and so i thought that this was an interesting idea , and i in@@ corpor@@ ated it into a design work@@ shop .
and it was a huge success .
and since then , i &apos;ve condu@@ c@@ ted about 70 design work@@ sh@@ ops across the world with students and designers and architects , even the c@@ to@@ s of the fortune 50 , and there &apos;s something about this exercise that reve@@ als very deep lessons about the nature of collaboration , and i &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
so , normally , most people begin by orient@@ ing themselves to the task .
they talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they j@@ oc@@ key for power , then they spend some time planning , organiz@@ ing .
they sk@@ et@@ ch and they lay out sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti they spend the majority of their time assembl@@ ing the sti@@ cks into ever@@ -@@ growing structures and then , finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and ta@@ -@@ da !
they ad@@ mi@@ re their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh , &quot; because the weight of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low causes the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to collapse .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moments than others , and among the worst are recent gradu@@ ates of business school .
they lie , they che@@ at , they get dis@@ trac@@ ted , and they produce really la@@ me structures .
and of course there are te@@ ams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; structures , and , among the best , are recent gradu@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
and it &apos;s pretty amazing .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est structures , but they &apos;re the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is : how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
and peter li@@ kes to say that , &quot; none of the kids spend any time trying to be ce@@ o of sp@@ ag@@ h@@ et@@ ti in@@ c . &quot; right .
they don &apos;t spend time j@@ oc@@ ke@@ ying for power .
but there &apos;s another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right .
and then they ex@@ ecu@@ te on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time , and what happens ?
it &apos;s a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
what kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differently , is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prototy@@ pes , succ@@ essive prototy@@ pes , always keeping the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multiple times to fix ill built prototy@@ pes along the way .
so designers recognize this type of collaboration as the essence of the it@@ er@@ ative process .
and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let &apos;s look at how different te@@ ams per@@ form .
so the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches , business schools students , about half of that , law@@ yers , a little better , but not much better than that , kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most adults .
who does the very best ?
architects and engineers , than@@ k@@ fully .
3@@ 9 in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure i &apos;ve seen .
and why is it ? because they understand tri@@ angles and self-@@ re-@@ en@@ forc@@ ing ge@@ om@@ e@@ tri@@ cal patterns are the key to building stable structures .
so ce@@ os , a little bit better than average .
but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
if you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ uti@@ ve ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
it &apos;s incredible . you know , you look around , you go , &quot; oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
you can just tell be@@ fore@@ hand . and why is that ?
because they have special skills of facilit@@ ation .
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and any team who man@@ ages and pays a close attention to work will signific@@ antly improve the team &apos;s performance .
speci@@ alized skills and facilit@@ ation skills are the combination leads to strong success .
if you have 10 te@@ ams that typically per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and i tried something interesting .
i thought , let &apos;s up the ante once .
so i off@@ ered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the win@@ ning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here &apos;s what happened .
not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they could have taken home the prize .
so , isn &apos;t it interesting that high st@@ a@@ kes have a strong impact .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of prototy@@ ping .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the t@@ all@@ est structures in the least amount of time .
so there &apos;s deep lessons for us about the nature of incenti@@ ves and success .
so , you might ask : why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
and the reason is , i help create digital tools and processes to help te@@ ams build cars and video games and visual effects .
and what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assu@@ mp@@ tions .
because , fran@@ kly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it .
the challenge provi@@ des a shared experience , a common language , common st@@ ance to build the right prototype .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
and those of you who are interested , may want to go to mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ chall@@ en@@ ge@@ .com .
it &apos;s a blog that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lows .
there &apos;s ste@@ p@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step instructions on this .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tw@@ ea@@ k and ad@@ just the system .
there &apos;s world records on this as well .
and the fundamental lesson , i believe , is that design truly is a contact sport .
it dem@@ ands that we bring all of our sen@@ ses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and , sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
